<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iii</span>TO
THE REV. JOHN DAVIES, OF BRIGHTON.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I believe
there is no man living to whom I could so appropriately inscribe
an attempt to give some appreciation of the life and labours of
Christmas Evans as yourself.&nbsp; Your revered father and he
were taken on the same evening into Church fellowship in the old
communion of Castell Hywel, and within a week of each other they
preached their first sermons from the same desk; after this their
ways diverged, Evans uniting himself with the Baptist Communion,
your father joining the Independent; still, like two rivers
flowing, and broadening, from neighbouring, but obscure springs
in the heart of their native Plynlymmon, cheerfully they ran
their beautiful course, beneath the providential law of Him who
chooses our inheritance for us, and fixes the bounds of our
habitations.&nbsp; They both served their generation in their own
land well, <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>before they fell on sleep.&nbsp; Your father was called
&ldquo;the Silver Trumpet of Wales,&rdquo; and the name of Evans
rolled like a far-resounding bell among its wild mountains.&nbsp;
In their early Christian life they were associates; in their
fame, while living, competent judges tell me they were equal; and
I have brought them together again.&nbsp; In the memories I have
sought to retain in this volume, I have attempted to give some
idea of what old Wild Wales was when these two brothers in arms
arose, and I have attempted to show what the singular institution
of preaching effected for the old insulated land.&nbsp; But I am
also glad to avail myself of the opportunity thus afforded me to
express my sense of mingled admiration, and affection for
yourself, and congratulation that the father, who left you an
orphan so young, must rejoice, from that cloud of witnesses he so
long since joined, to know that you followed him in a successful
and happy ministry; while I rejoice, that, unlike him, you have
been permitted to enjoy the sunset in a serene and golden old
age.&nbsp; May you long enjoy it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">My Dear Friend,<br />
I am very affectionately<br />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> propose, in the following pages,
to give some account of Christmas Evans, the great Welsh
preacher; believing that he had a style and manner of preaching
which, to English minds and readers, will seem altogether his
own, perhaps more admirable than imitable.&nbsp; But before we
enter upon the delineation of his life, or attempt to unfold his
style, or to represent his method as displayed in his sermons, it
may be well to present some concise view of Welsh preaching and
Welsh preachers in general, especially those of the last age; for
as an <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>order
of preaching it has possessed its own very distinctive
peculiarities.&nbsp; Some readers may at first indeed inquire, Is
not preaching very much the same everywhere, in all counties and
in all countries?&nbsp; And Wales, which seems itself in its
nearness now only like a district of England, and that district
for the most part wild and but scantily peopled,&mdash;can there
be anything so remarkable about its pulpit work as to make it
either capable or worthy of any separate account of its
singularities and idiosyncrasies?&nbsp; To most English people
Welsh preaching is a phase of religious life entirely unknown:
thousands of tourists visit the more conspicuous highways of
Wales from year to year, its few places of public resort or more
manifest beauty; but Wales is still, for the most part, unknown;
its isolation is indeed somewhat disturbed now, its villages are
no longer so insulated as of old, and the sounds of advancing
life are breaking in upon its solitudes, yet, perhaps, its
fairest scenes are still uninvaded.&nbsp; But if the country be
unknown, still more unknown are the people, and of its singular
preaching phenomena scarcely anything is known, or ever can be
known by English people; yet it is not too much to say that, in
that little land, during the last hundred years, amidst its wild
glens and sombre mountain shadows, its villages retreating into
desolate moorlands and winding vales, where seldom a traveller
passes by, there have appeared such a succession and race of
remarkable preachers as could be rivalled&mdash;in their own
peculiar popular power over the hearts and minds of many
thousands, for their eminence and variety&mdash;in no other
country.&nbsp; Among <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>these, Christmas Evans seems to us singularly
representative; eminently Welsh, his attributes of power seem to
be especially indicative of the characteristics of the Welsh
mind, an order of mind as remarkably singular and individual, and
worthy of study, as any national character in the great human
family.&nbsp; But even before we mention these, it may be well to
notice what were some of the reasons for the eminent influence
and usefulness of Christmas Evans, and some of his extraordinary
preaching comrades and contemporaries to whom we shall have
occasion to refer.</p>
<p>Preaching is, in Wales, the great national characteristic; the
Derby Day is not more truly a characteristic of England than the
great gatherings and meetings of the Associations all grouped
around some popular favourites.&nbsp; The dwellers among those
mountains and upon those hill-sides have no concerts, no
theatres, no means of stimulating or satisfying their
curiosity.&nbsp; For we, who care little for preaching, to whom
the whole sermon system is perhaps becoming more tedious, can
form but little idea, and have but little sympathy with that form
of religious society where the pulpit is the orchestra, the
stage, and the platform, and where the charms of music, painting,
and acting are looked for, and found in the preacher.&nbsp; We
very likely would be disposed even to look with complacent pity
upon such a state of society,&mdash;it has not yet
expired,&mdash;where the Bulwers, the Dickenses, the Thackerays,
and Scotts are altogether unknown,&mdash;but where the peculiar
forms of their genius&mdash;certainly without their peculiar
education&mdash;display themselves <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>in the pulpit.&nbsp; If our readers
suppose, therefore, a large amount of ignorance,&mdash;well, upon
such a subject, certainly, it is possible to enter easily upon
the illimitable.&nbsp; Yet it is such an ignorance as that which
developed itself in Job, and in his companions, and in his
age&mdash;an ignorance like that which we may conceive in
&AElig;schylus.&nbsp; In fact, in Wales, the gates of every
man&rsquo;s being have been opened.&nbsp; It is possible to know
much of the grammar, and the history, and the lexicography of
things, and yet to be so utterly ignorant of <i>things</i> as
never to have felt the sentiment of strangeness and of terror;
and without having been informed about the names of things, it is
possible to have been brought into the presence and power of
<i>things</i> themselves.&nbsp; Thus, the ignorance of one man
may be higher than the intelligence of another.&nbsp; There may
be a large memory and a very narrow consciousness.&nbsp; On the
contrary, there may be a large consciousness, while the forms it
embraces may be uncertain and undefined in the misty twilight of
the soul.&nbsp; This is much the state of many minds in
Wales.&nbsp; It is the state of feeling, and of poetry, of subtle
questionings, high religious musings, and raptures.&nbsp; This
state has been aided by the secludedness of the country, and the
exclusiveness of the language,&mdash;not less than by the rugged
force and masculine majesty and strength of the language;&mdash;a
language full of angles and sharp goads, admirably fitted for the
masters of assemblies, admirably fitted to move like a wind over
the soul, rousing and soothing, stirring into storm, and lulling
into rest.&nbsp; Something in it makes an orator almost ludicrous
when he attempts <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>to convey himself in another language, but very powerful
and impressive in that.&nbsp; It is a speaking and living
language, a language without any shallows, a language which seems
to compel the necessity of thought before using it.&nbsp; Our
language is fast becoming serviceable for all that large part of
the human family who speak without thinking.&nbsp; To this state
the Welsh can never come.&nbsp; That unaccommodating tongue only
moves with a soul behind it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the first reason, but it is not unimportant to
remember, that, until very recently, the pulpit in Wales has been
the only means of popular excitement, instruction, or even of
entertainment; until very recently the Welsh, like the ancient
Hebrew lady, have dwelt among their own people, they have
possessed no popular fictions, no published poems, no published
emanations either of metaphysics or natural science; immured in
their own language, as they were, less than a century since,
among their own mountains, their language proved a barrier to the
importation of many works accessible to almost all the other
languages of Europe.&nbsp; It may be said that religion, as
represented through the men of the pulpit, has made Wales what
she is.&nbsp; When the first men of the pulpit, Howell Harris,
Daniel Rowlands, and others, arose, they found their country
lying under a night of spiritual darkness, and they effected an
amazing reformation; but then they had no competitive influences
to interfere with their progress, or none beyond that rough, rude
sensuality, that barbarism of character, which everywhere sets
itself in an attitude of hostility to spiritual <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>truth and to
elevated holiness; there were no theatres or race courses, there
was no possibility that the minds of the multitudes should be
occupied by the intellectual casuistries of a later day; Wales
possessed no Universities or Colleges, and very few Schools; on
the other hand, there were some characteristics of the national
mind very favourable to the impulse these men gave, and the
impressions they produced.&nbsp; So it has happened that the
Welsh preacher has been elevated into an importance, reminding us
of the Welsh tradition concerning St. David, the patron saint of
Wales, regarding whom it is said, that, while preaching in the
year 520, in Cardigan, against the Pelagian heresy, such was the
force of his argument, and the eloquence of his oratory, that the
very ground on which he stood rose beneath his feet and elevated
itself into a hillock; and there, in after ages, a church was
erected upon the spot to which awful tradition pointed as the
marvellous pulpit of the patron saint.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of any amount of power which either or any of
these first preachers, or their successors, have obtained over
their countrymen, and countrywomen, arises from the fact that the
Welsh possess, in an eminent degree, what we call a Religious
Nature; they are very open to Wonder; they have a most keen and
curious propensity to inquire into the hidden causes of things,
not mere material causes, but Spiritual causes, what we call
Metaphysics; the Unseen Universe is to them as to all of us a
mystery, but it is a mystery over which they cannot but brood;
when education is lacking, this realizing of the unseen is apt to
give rise to <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>superstitious feelings, and superstitions still loiter
and linger among the glens, the churchyards, and old castles and
ruins of Wales, although the spread of Christian truth has
divested them of much of their ancient extravagance; when,
therefore, the earnest voice of their native speech became the
vehicle for unfolding the higher doctrines of the Christian life,
the sufferings of the Redeemer and their relation to eternal laws
and human conditions, probably a people was never found whose
ears were more open, or whose hearts were more ready to receive,
and to be stirred to their utmost depths.&nbsp; Thus
Religion&mdash;Evangelical Religion&mdash;became the very life of
the land of Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a heathen man, woman, or child in all the
Principality,&rdquo; said a very eminent Welshman to us once,
probably with some measure of exaggeration; &ldquo;there are
wicked men, and women,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;unconverted
men, and women, but there is not a man, woman, or child
throughout Wales who does not know all about Jesus Christ, and
why He came into the world, and what He came to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus, within the memory of the writer of this volume, Religion
was the one topic upon which you might talk intelligently
anywhere in Wales: with the pitman in the coalmine, with the
iron-smelter at the forge, with the farmer by his ingleside, with
the labourer in his mountain shieling; and not merely on the
first more elementary lessons of the catechism, but on the great
bearings and infinite relations of religious things.&nbsp;
Jonathan Edwards, and Williams of Rotherham, and Owen, and
Bunyan, and Flavel,&mdash;these men and their works, and a few <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>others like
them, were well known; and, especially, the new aspects which the
modified opinions of Andrew Fuller had introduced into religious
thought; thus, you might often feel surprised when, sitting down
in some lowly cottage, you found yourself suddenly caught, and
carried along by its owner in a coil of metaphysical
argument.&nbsp; This was the soil on which the Welsh preachers
had to work, and cast abroad their seed.</p>
<p>No person can have heard anything of the Welsh religious life
without having heard also of the immense annual gatherings, the
Association meetings, a sort of great movable festival, annually
held in Wales, to which everything had to give place, and to
which all the various tribes of the various Houses of the Lord
came up.&nbsp; Their ordinary Sunday services were crowded, but,
upon these great occasions, twenty or twenty-five thousand people
would come together; and, to such congregations, their great men,
their great preachers, such as those we are about to mention,
addressed themselves&mdash;addressed themselves not to a mass
ignorant and unintelligent, but all thoroughly informed in
religious matters, and prepared to follow their preacher
whithersoever his imagination or thought might lead him.&nbsp;
The reader must not smile when we remind him that Wales
was,&mdash;had been for ages,&mdash;the land of Bards; a love of
poetry, poetry chanted or recited, had always been the
Welshman&rsquo;s passion, and those great writers of our
literature who best know what poetry is, have taught us that we
are not to look upon those productions with contempt.&nbsp; For
ages there had been held in Wales what has been called, and <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>is still called
the <i>Eisteddfod</i>, or <i>Cymreigyddion</i>, or the meeting of
the Bards and Minstrels; they were, as Pennant has called them,
British Olympics, where none but Bards of merit were suffered to
rehearse their pieces, or Minstrels of skill to perform.&nbsp;
These Association meetings were a kind of religious Eisteddfodd,
where the great Welsh preacher was a kind of sacred Bard; he knew
nothing of written sermons; he carried no notes nor writings with
him to his pulpit or platform, but he made the law and doctrine
of religious metaphysics march to the minstrelsy and music of
speech; on the other hand, he did not indulge himself in casting
about wildfire, all had been thoroughly prepared and rooted in
his understanding; and then he went with his sermon, which was a
kind of high song, to chant it over the hearts of the
multitude.&nbsp; We shall have occasion to show, by many
instances, from the lives of their greatest men, how their own
hearts had been marvellously prepared.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant anecdote told of one of them, Gryffyth of
Caernarvon, how he had to preach one night.&nbsp; Before
preaching, staying at a farmhouse on the spot, he desired
permission to retire before the service began; he remained in his
room a considerable time; the congregation had assembled, still
he did not come; there was no sign of his making his
appearance.&nbsp; The good man of the house sent the servant to
request him to come, as the people had been for some time
assembled and waiting.&nbsp; Approaching the room she heard, what
seemed to her to be a conversation, going on between two persons,
in a subdued tone of voice, and she caught from Mr. <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Gryffyth the
expression, &ldquo;<i>I</i> will not go unless <i>you</i> come
with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went back to her master, and said,
&ldquo;I do not think Mr. Gryffyth will come to-night; there is
some one with him, and he is telling him that he will not come
unless the other will come too; but I did not hear the other
reply, so I think Mr. Gryffyth will not come to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;<i>he</i> will
come, and I warrant the <i>other</i> will come too, if matters
are as you say between them; but we had better begin singing and
reading until the <i>two</i> do come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the story
goes on to say that Mr. Gryffyth did come, and the other One with
him, for they had a very extraordinary meeting that night, and
the whole neighbourhood was stirred by it and numbers were
changed and converted.&nbsp; It was Williams of Wern who used to
tell this pleasing anecdote; it is an anecdote of one man, but,
so far as we have been able to see, it illustrates the way in
which they all prepared themselves before they began to
speak.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed from this that they imagined that
prayer was to dispense with preparation; their great preachers
studied hard and deeply, and Williams of Wern, one of the
greatest of them all, says, &ldquo;In order to be a good
preacher, usefulness must be the grand aim, usefulness must
choose the text and divide it, usefulness must compose the sermon
and sit at the helm during the delivery; if the introduction be
not clear and pertinent it is evident the preacher does not know
whither he is going, and if the inferences are of the same
character, it is obvious he does not know where he has
been.&nbsp; Unstudied sermons are not worth hearing or having; <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>who would
trust his life in the hands of a physician who had never thought
of his profession?&rdquo;&nbsp; But these men never permitted the
understanding to supersede emotion, and, when they met the people
face to face, the greatest of them went prepared, warmed and
kindled, and ready to warm and kindle.</p>
<p>Thus their sermons became a sort of inspired song, full of
imagination&mdash;imagination very often, and usually, deriving
its imagery from no far-off and recondite allusions, never losing
itself in a flowery wilderness of expressions, but homely
illustrations, ministered to by the things and affairs of
ordinary life, and, therefore, instantly preacher and people in
emotion were one.</p>
<p>It is indeed true that many of their great preachers repeated
the same sermon many times.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; So did
Whitfield, so did Wesley, so have most eminent preachers done;
but this need in no way interfere with&mdash;it did not interfere
with&mdash;the felt necessity for unction on the part of the
minister; and as to the people they liked to hear an old
favourite again, or a sermon, which they had never heard although
they had heard much about it.&nbsp; We believe it was to
Christmas Evans a pert young preacher said, &ldquo;Well, you have
given us an old sermon again to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then, my boy?&rdquo; said the Master of
Assemblies; &ldquo;had you a new one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but look you,&rdquo; said the unblushing old
culprit, &ldquo;I would not take a dozen new sermons like yours
for this one old sermon of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;No, nor I,&rdquo; chimed in a gruff old
deacon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, and look you, I should like to hear
it again; but as for <i>yours</i>, I never heard it before, and I
do not want to hear it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then the <i>Language</i>!&nbsp; Of course the language had
a great deal to do with this preaching power, we do not mean
generally, but particularly; on all hands the Welsh is
acknowledged to be a wonderful language.&nbsp; A Welshman will
tell you that there is no language like it on the face of the
earth, but that is a testimony borne by many scholars who are not
Welshmen; perhaps there is no other language which so instantly
conveys a meaning and at the same time touches emotion to the
quick.&nbsp; True, like the Welshman himself, it is bony, and
strangers to its power laugh somewhat ignorantly at its
never-ending succession of consonants.&nbsp; Somebody has said
that the whole language is as if it were made up of such words as
our word &ldquo;<i>strength</i>,&rdquo; and if the reader will
compare in his mind the effect of the word <i>power</i> as
contrasted with the word <i>strength</i>, he will feel something
of the force of the language, and its fitness for the purposes of
impression; but still this conveys but a poor idea of its great
attributes.</p>
<p>It is so <i>literal</i> that the competent hearer, or reader,
instantly realizes, from its words, things.&nbsp; Well do we
remember sitting in Wales with a group of Welsh ministers and
Welshmen round a pleasant tea-table; we were talking of the Welsh
language, and one of our company, who had perhaps done more than
any one of his own country for popular Welsh literature, and was
one of the order of eminent Welsh preachers of whom we are
speaking, broke forth: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>said,
&ldquo;you English people cannot see all the things in your Bible
that a Welshman can see; now your word
&lsquo;<i>blessed</i>,&rsquo; it seems a very dear sweet thing to
an Englishman and to a Welshman, but a Welshman sees the
<i>thing</i> in the word, &lsquo;<i>Gwyn ei fyd</i>,&rsquo; that
is, &lsquo;<i>a white world</i>&mdash;white,&rsquo; literally,
white their world; so a Welshman would see there is a
&lsquo;<i>white world</i>&rsquo; for the pure in heart, a
&lsquo;<i>white world</i>&rsquo; for the poor in spirit, a
&lsquo;<i>white world</i>&rsquo; for them who are reviled and
persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake; and when you read,
&lsquo;<i>Blessed</i> is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not
iniquity,&rsquo; the Welshman reads his Bible and sees there is a
&lsquo;<i>white world</i>&rsquo; for such a one, that is, all sin
wiped out, the place quite clean, to begin again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not all.&nbsp; We are not intending to devote any
considerable space to a vindication of the Welsh language, but,
when we speak of it with reference to the effects it produces as
the vehicle of Oratory, it is necessary to remark that, so far
from being,&mdash;as many have supposed who have only looked at
it in its strange combination of letters on a page, perhaps
unable to read it, and never having heard it spoken,&mdash;so far
from being harsh and rugged, coarse or guttural, it probably
yields to no language in delicious softness, in melting
sweetness; in this it has been likened to the Italian language by
those who have been best able to judge.&nbsp; Lord Lyttleton, in
his &ldquo;Letters from Wales,&rdquo; says, that when he first
passed some of the Welsh hills, and heard the harp and the
beautiful female peasants accompanying it with their melodious
voices, he could not help indulging in the idea that he had
descended the Alps, and was <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>enjoying the harmonious pleasures of
the Italian Paradise.&nbsp; And as we have already said, there
has long prevailed an idea that the Welsh language is a multitude
of consonants; but indeed the reverse is the case; the learned
Eliezer Williams says, in his &ldquo;Historical Anecdotes of the
Welsh Language,&rdquo; &ldquo;The alphabet itself demonstrates
that the charge of a multiplicity of consonants is fallacious,
since, whether the number of letters be reckoned twenty-two or
twenty-four, seven are vowels; there remain therefore a more
inconsiderable number than most of the European languages are
obliged to admit . . . .&nbsp; <i>Y</i> and <i>w</i> are
considered as vowels, and sounded as such; <i>w</i> is pronounced
like <i>o u</i> in French in the word <i>oui</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
persons ignorant of the language, how strange is the appearance,
and how erroneous the idea of the sound to be conveyed by
<i>dd</i>, <i>ll</i>, <i>ch</i>, but indeed all these are
indications of the softening of the letter; in a word, the
impressions entertained of the harshness of the language are
altogether erroneous.</p>
<p>The supposition that the Welsh language is made up of
consonants is more especially singular from the fact that it
possesses, says a writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, what
perhaps no other nation has,&mdash;a poem of eight lines in which
there is not a single consonant.&nbsp; These verses are very old,
dating from the seventeenth century;&mdash;of course the reader
will remember that the Welsh language has seven vowels, both
<i>w</i> and <i>y</i> being considered and sounded as such.&nbsp;
This epigram or poem is on the Spider, and originally stood
thus,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;i wiw &#373;y i weu e
&acirc;;&mdash;o&rsquo;i iau Ei wyau a wea,<br />
E wywa ei w&ecirc; aua, A&rsquo;i weau yw ieuau ia.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>To
this, the great Gronwy Owen added a kind of counter change of
vowels, and the translation has been given as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From out its womb it weaves with care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its web beneath the roof;<br />
Its wintry web it spreadeth there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wires of ice its woof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And doth it weave against the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thin ropes of ice on high?<br />
And must its little liver all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wondrous stuff supply?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A singular illustration of the vowel power in a language
ignorantly supposed to possess no vowels.</p>
<p>And these remarks are not at all unnecessary, for they
illustrate to the reader, unacquainted with the language, the way
in which it becomes such a means of immediate emotion; its words
start before the eye like pictures, but are conveyed to the mind
like music; and yet the bony character of the language, to which
we have referred before, adds to the picture dramatic action and
living strength.&nbsp; What a language, then, is this for a
competent orator to play upon,&mdash;a man with an imaginative
mind, and a fervid and fiery soul!&nbsp; Then is brought into
play that element of Welsh preaching, without knowing and
apprehending which there would be no possibility of understanding
the secret of its great power; it is the
&ldquo;<i>hwyl</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the Welsh preacher speaks
in his best mood, and with great unction, the highest compliment
that can be paid him, the loftiest commendation that can be
given, is, that he had the &ldquo;<i>hwyl</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Hwyl</i>&rdquo; is the Welsh word for the canvas of a
ship; and probably the derivation of the meaning <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>is, from the
canvas or sails of a ship filled with a breeze: the word for
breeze, <i>awel</i>, is like it, and is used to denote a similar
effect.&nbsp; Some years since, when the most eminent Welsh
preacher we have recently seen in England, at an ordination
service, was addressing his nephew in a crowded church in the
neighbourhood of London, he said, &ldquo;And, my dear boy,
remember you are a Welshman; don&rsquo;t try to speak English,
and don&rsquo;t try to speak like the English.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
great many of his hearers wondered what the good man could mean;
but both he and his nephew, and several others of the initiated,
very well knew.&nbsp; He meant, speak your words with an
<i>accent</i>, and an accent formed from a soul giving life and
meaning to an expression.&nbsp; This, we know, is what the singer
does,&mdash;this is what the musician tries to do.&nbsp; All
words are not the same words in their meaning; the Welsh preacher
seeks to play upon them as keys; the words themselves help him to
do so.&nbsp; Literally, they are full of meaning; verbally, he
attempts to pronounce that meaning; hence, as he rises in feeling
he rises in variety of intonation, and his words sway to and fro,
up and down,&mdash;bass, minor, and soprano all play their part,
a series of intonings.&nbsp; In English, this very frequently
sounds monotonous, sometimes even affected; in Welsh, the soul of
the man is said to have caught the <i>hwyl</i>,&mdash;that is, he
is in full sail, he has feeling and fire: the people catch it
too.&nbsp; A Welsh writer, describing this, quotes the words of
Jean Paul Richter: &ldquo;Pictures during music are seen into
more deeply and warmly by spectators; nay, many masters have in
creating them acknowledged help from music.&rdquo;&nbsp; Great
Welsh <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>preaching, is very often a kind of wild, irregular
chant, a jubilant refrain, recurring again and again.&nbsp; The
people catch the power of it; shouts rise&mdash;prayers!&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Bendigedig</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; or
synonymous with our &ldquo;Bless the Lord!&rdquo;) Amen!
&ldquo;<i>Diolch byth</i>!&rdquo; and other expressions, rise,
and roll over the multitude; they, too, have caught the
<i>hwyl</i>.&nbsp; It is singular that, with us, the only
circumstances and scenes in which such manifestations can take
place, are purely secular, or on the occasions of great public
meetings.&nbsp; The Welshman very much estimates the greatness of
a preacher by his power to move men; but it does not follow, that
this power shall be associated with great apparent bodily
action.&nbsp; The words of John Elias and Williams of Wern
consumed like flames, and divided like swords; but they were men
of immense self-possession, and apparently very quiet.&nbsp; It
has always been the aim of the greater Welsh preachers to find
out such &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;&mdash;that is, fitting and
piercing&mdash;words, so that the words alone shall have the
effect of action.</p>
<p>But, in any account of Welsh preaching, the place ought never
to be forgotten&mdash;the scenery.&nbsp; We have said, the
country is losing, now, many of its old characteristics of
solitude and isolation; the railways are running along at the
foot of the tall mountains, and spots, which we knew thirty years
since as hamlets and villages, have now grown into large
towns.&nbsp; It has often been the case, that populations born
and reared amidst remote mountain solitudes, have possessed
strong religious susceptibilities.&nbsp; The Welshman&rsquo;s
chapel was very frequently reared in the midst of an unpeopled
district, likely to provoke wonder in <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the mind of the passing stranger, as
to whence it could derive its congregation.&nbsp; The building
was erected there because it was favourable to a confluence of
neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Take a region near to the spot where
Christmas Evans was born,&mdash;a wild, mountainous tract of
country, lying between the counties Brecon and Cardigan; for long
miles, in every direction, there are no human
habitations,&mdash;only, perhaps, here and there, in a deep
dingle, some lone house, the residence of a sheep farmer, with
three or four cultivated fields in its immediate neighbourhood;
and at some distance, on the slopes of the mountain, an
occasional shepherd&rsquo;s hut.&nbsp; It is a scene of the
wildest magnificence.&nbsp; The traveller, as he passes along,
discerns nothing but a sea of mountains,&mdash;rugged and
precipitous bluffs, and precipices innumerable; here the grand
and sportive streams, the Irvon, the Towy, and the Dothia, spring
from their rocky channels, and tumble along, rushing and gurgling
with deafening roar; here, as you pass along, you encounter more
than one or two &ldquo;wolves&rsquo; leaps;&rdquo;&mdash;dark
caverns are there, from whence these brotherly rivers rush into
each other&rsquo;s embrace.&nbsp; These regions, when we were in
the habit of crossing them, many years since,&mdash;and we often
crossed them,&mdash;we very naturally regarded as the Highlands,
the sequestered mountain retreats, of Wales; this was Twm Shon
Catty&rsquo;s, the Welsh Rob Roy&rsquo;s, country; for let
Scotland boast as she will&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wales has had a thief as good,<br />
She has her own Rob Roy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And wonderfully romantic is the story of this same <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Welsh
gentleman, and predatory chieftain.&nbsp; Here you find, to this
day, his cave, from whence the bold and humorous outlaw was wont
to spring forth, to spread terror and rapine over the whole
region.&nbsp; It is thirty years since we passed through these
desolations; they are probably much the same now as they were
then; let the traveller shout as he will as he passes along, it
is not from any human being, it is only from the wild rock, or
screaming bird, he will have a reply.</p>
<p>Now, what do our readers think of a large and commodious
chapel in the midst of a wild region like this?&nbsp; But one
there is, in the very heart of the wilderness.&nbsp; Up to this
place the worshippers come, on Sabbath mornings, from distances
varying from two to eight miles.&nbsp; It is a
Calvinistic-Methodist chapel; and the Rev. William Williams, in
his interesting little historical sketch of Welsh
Calvinistic-Methodism, tells how he preached in this building,
several years since, when the chapel was crowded with
worshippers; and in the yard adjoining, between fifty and sixty
ponies, which had borne the worshippers to the place, with or
without vehicles, were waiting the time for the return
journey.&nbsp; This building had its birth from a congregation
gathered first in one of the farm houses in these inaccessible
wilds, in 1847.&nbsp; It seems strange to think how far people
will travel to Divine Service when they have no such service near
their own doors.&nbsp; We were struck with this, a short time
since, in Norway; we found our way to a little village church,
and there, on a spot where was next to no population, we found
the Lutheran church crowded; and outside, a large square space
thronged <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>with carioles, ancient old shandydan landaus, carts, and
every kind of conveyance,&mdash;horses and ponies stabled in the
sheds all round; and we learned that many of the congregation had
travelled in this way, beside the numbers who had walked, twelve,
sixteen, eighteen miles to the service.</p>
<p>And thus, also, in Wales, many were the long and weary miles
usually traversed, and through every variety of weather; and it
seemed to be usually thought that the service, or services,
repaid all the toil.&nbsp; And there was very little, externally,
to aid the imagination, or to charm the taste, either in the
building itself, or in the ritual adopted;&mdash;all was of the
plainest and most severe order.&nbsp; The building, no doubt, was
little more than a shelter from the weather; generally, perhaps,
huge and capacious,&mdash;that was necessary,&mdash;but it was
quite unadorned; the minister had nothing in the way of robes or
attire to aid the impressions of reverence; there was no
organ,&mdash;usually no instrument of any
description,&mdash;although if an entire stranger to the language
had entered, and heard the long, low, plaintive wail of almost
any of their hymns,&mdash;most of them seeming to express a kind
of dirge-like feeling of an exiled, conquered, and trampled
people, a tone with its often-renewed refrain, its long-drawn
minor, now sobbing into grief, occasionally swelling into
triumph,&mdash;he might have found the notes of an organ were not
needed to compel the unexpected tear.&nbsp; An exiled, conquered,
and trampled people,&mdash;that expresses a great deal of
truth.&nbsp; Wales has wrongs quite as bitter as any which
Ireland ever knew;&mdash;the very cause of the existence of most
of her chapels arose from the fact <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>that, in many of her parish churches,
not a word of Welsh was spoken; and perhaps frequently their
ministers could not speak the native language;&mdash;the very
judges who dispensed justice from the Bench were usually English,
and needed an interpreter, that they might be able to understand
the case upon which they were to give a judgment.&nbsp; Wales has
had very little for which to thank England, but her people have
never been seditious.&nbsp; Pious, industrious people, with their
simple amusements and weird superstitions, and blossoming out
into their great religious revivals and reformations, they have
had to thank themselves, chiefly, for all the good which has
unfolded itself upon their soil.&nbsp; These circumstances,
however, have no doubt aided their peculiar and isolated
religious life.</p>
<p>But, in those great assemblies, the Association meetings to
which we have referred, many of the great preachers stood, with
their vast congregations round them, in Nature&rsquo;s open
Cathedral.&nbsp; Christmas Evans preached many of his noblest
sermons amidst the imposing ruins of Caerphilly, Pembroke, and
Manobear Castles; or the preacher found himself with his audience
on the slope of some sweet, gorse-covered hill, in the
neighbourhood of tumbling torrents, which did not sing so loudly
in their melody as to interfere with the sweet restfulness of the
surrounding scene.&nbsp; Preachers and hearers were accustomed to
plain living,&mdash;one of the most essential conditions of high
thinking; neither of them knew anything of luxury; and when most
of them spoke, the age of luxury, even with us, had not yet set
in.&nbsp; Bread and milk, or oatmeal and milk, were the favourite
diet of all, in those days; even tea was all <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>but unknown,
and the potato almost their nearest approach to a dainty
dish.&nbsp; They lived on good terms with Nature, with whom we
have been quarrelling now for some years past; and thus they were
prepared to receive such lessons as Nature might give, to aid and
illustrate the deeper lessons of Divine Grace.</p>
<p>Of course, there was considerable uncertainty about the
services,&mdash;excepting those more imposing and important
occasions; and this gave, very frequently, a tone of the
ludicrous to their announcement of the services.&nbsp; Thus, if a
stranger asked what time the service would commence, it would
often have been quite impossible to get any information; and
failures, says Mr. D. M. Evans, were so frequent, that the
announcement was often made with perfect gravity, &ldquo;&mdash;
will be here next Sunday, if he comes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Evans
continues, that he well knew a deacon who claimed the prerogative
to make announcements to the congregation, but who every week was
guilty of such blunders, that he was implored to resign the
honour to some other brother; to which he indignantly replied,
that it was his crown, and was he not told in Scripture,
&ldquo;Hold fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy
crown&rdquo;?&nbsp; Often, when the preacher appeared, he showed
himself in the pulpit almost out of breath, sometimes in sad
disarray, sometimes apparently as if smothered with wrappers and
top-coats; and by his panting and puffing, as someone said,
&ldquo;seeming to show that God Almighty had asked him to preach
the Gospel, but had given him no time for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a word, it is impossible, knowing Wales as we <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>know it in
our own day, to form any very distinct idea of the country as it
was when these great preachers arose; and, when the tides of a
new spiritual life rolled over the Principality, the singular
relics of even heathenish superstition were loitering still among
the secluded valleys and mountains of the land.&nbsp; No doubt,
the proclamation of the Gospel, and the elevated faith which its
great truths bring in its train, broke the fascination, the
charm, and power of many of these; but they lingered even until
within the last forty or fifty years,&mdash;indeed, the
superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> linger even now in the secluded vale of
Cwm-Aman, in Caermarthenshire.&nbsp; The meaning of this most
singular institution of superstition was, that when a person
died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on
his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of
the deceased person; he then uttered an incantation over the
bread, after which, he proceeded to eat it,&mdash;thereby eating
the sins of the dead person; this done, he received a fee of
two-and-sixpence,&mdash;which, we suppose, was much more than
many a preacher received for a long and painful service.&nbsp;
Having received this, he vanished as swiftly as possible, all the
friends and relatives of the departed aiding his exit with blows
and kicks, and other indications of their faith in the service he
had rendered.&nbsp; A hundred years since, and through the ages
beyond that time, we suppose this curious superstition was
everywhere prevalent.</p>
<p>Another odd custom was the manner in which public opinion
expressed itself on account of any domestic or social
delinquency.&nbsp; A large crowd assembled <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>before the
house of the delinquent, one of whom was dressed up in what
seemed to be a horse&rsquo;s head; the crowd then burst forth
into strong vituperative abuse, accompanying the execrations with
the rough music of old kettles, marrow-bones, and cleavers;
finally, the effigy of the sinner was burnt before the house, and
the sacred wrath of the multitude appeased.&nbsp; The majesty of
outraged opinion being vindicated, they dispersed.</p>
<p>Some superstitions were of a more gentle character; the
fairies, or &ldquo;little men in green,&rdquo; as they were
popularly called, continued to hold their tenantry of Wales long
after they had departed from England; and even Glamorganshire,
one of the counties nearest to England,&mdash;its roads forming
the most considerable highway through Wales,&mdash;was, perhaps,
the county where they lingered last; certainly not many years
have passed by since, in the Vale of Neath, in the same county,
there would have been a fear in taking some secluded pathway in
the night, lest the &ldquo;little people&rdquo; should be
offended by the intrusion upon their haunts.</p>
<p>With all these singular observances and superstitions, there
was yet a kind of Christian faith prevalent among the people, but
buried beneath dark ignorance and social folly.&nbsp; At
Christmas time, at night, it was usual to illuminate all the
churches in the villages.&nbsp; And upon the New Year&rsquo;s
morning, children came waking the dawning, knocking at the
doors,&mdash;usually obtaining admittance,&mdash;when they
proceeded to sprinkle the furniture with water, singing as they
did so the following words, which we quote on account of their
quaint, sweet, old-world simplicity:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Here we bring new water from the well so
clear,<br />
For to worship God with this happy new year.<br />
Sing levy dew, sing levy dew, the water and the wine,<br />
With seven bright gold wires and bugles that do shine.<br />
Sing reign of fair maid, with gold upon her toe,<br />
Open you the west door, and turn the old year go.<br />
Sing reign of fair maid, with gold upon her chin,<br />
Open you the east door, and let the new year in.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is admitted on all hands that the dissolution of the mists
of darkness and superstition is owing to the people usually
called Dissenters; the Church of the Establishment&mdash;and this
is said in no spirit of unkindness&mdash;did very little to
humanise or soften the rugged character, or to put to flight the
debasing habits of the people.&nbsp; Of course, there are high
and honourable exceptions; but while many clergymen devoted
themselves, with great enthusiasm, to the perpetuation of the
singular lore, the wild bardic songs, the triads, or the strange
fables and mythic histories of the country, we can call to mind
the names of but very few who attempted to improve, or to
ameliorate, the social condition.&nbsp; So that the preachers,
and the vast gatherings of the people by whom the preachers were
surrounded, when the rays of knowledge were shed abroad, and
devotion fired, were not so much the result of any antagonism to
the Established Church,&mdash;<i>that</i> came afterwards; they
were a necessity created by the painful exigencies of the
country.</p>
<p>The remarks on the superstitions of Wales are not at all
irrelevant to the more general observations on Welsh preaching;
they are so essentially inwoven with the type of character, and
nationality.&nbsp; The Welsh appears to be intimately related to
the <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Breton; the languages assimilate,&mdash;so also do the
folk-lores of the people; and the traditions and fanciful fables
which have been woven from the grasses of the field, the leaves
of the forest, and the clouds of the heavens, would have
furnished Christmas Evans with allegoric texts which he might
have expanded into sermons.&nbsp; It is not possible to doubt
that these form one branch, from the great Celtic stem, of the
human family.&nbsp; And not only are they alike in language and
tradition, but also in the melancholy religiousness, in the
metaphysical brooding over natural causes, and in the absence of
any genuine humour, except in some grim or gloomy and grotesque
utterance.&nbsp; The stories, the heroes, and the heroines, are
very much the same; historic memory in both looks back to a
fantastic fairyland, and presents those fantastic pictures of
cities and castles strangely submerged beneath the sea, and
romantic shadows and spectral forms of wonderful kings and
queens, such as we meet in the Mabinogi of Taliesin, in the Fairy
Queen of Spenser, and in the Idylls of our Laureate.&nbsp; Thus,
all that could stir wonder, excite the imagination and the fancy,
and describe the nearness of the supernatural to the natural,
would become very charming to a Welshman&rsquo;s ears; and we
instantly have suggested to us one of the sources of the power
and popularity of Christmas Evans with his countrymen.</p>
<p>Even the spread and prevalence of Christian knowledge have
scarcely disenchanted Wales of its superstitions.&nbsp; Few
persons who know anything at all of the country, however slight
such knowledge may be, are unaware of this characteristic of the
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>people.&nbsp; This remark was, no doubt, far more
applicable even twenty-five years since than now.&nbsp; The
writer of this volume has listened to the stories of many who
believed that they had seen the
<i>Canwyll-y-corph</i>&mdash;corpse-candles&mdash;wending their
way from houses, more or less remote, to the churchyard.&nbsp;
Mr. Borrow, also, in his &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; tells us how
he conversed with people in his travels who believed that they
had seen the corpse-candles.&nbsp; But a hundred years ago, this
was a universal object of faith; as was also the belief in
coffins and burial trains seen wending their way, in the dead of
night, to the churchyard.&nbsp; Omens and predictions abounded
everywhere, while singular legends and traditions in many
districts hung also round church bells.&nbsp; And yet with all
this the same writer, remarking on Welsh character, says,
&ldquo;What a difference between a Welshman and an Englishman of
the lower class!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had just been conversing with a
miller&rsquo;s man,&mdash;a working labourer in the lowliest walk
of life; and found him conversant with the old poets, and the old
traditions of the country, and quite interested in them; and he
says, &ldquo;What would a Suffolk miller&rsquo;s man have said,
if I had repeated to him verses out of Beowulf or even Chaucer,
and had asked him about the residence of Skelton?&rdquo;&nbsp; We
must bear this in mind as we attempt to estimate the character
with which the preacher had to deal.&nbsp; Haunted houses were
numerous.&nbsp; A lonely old place, very distinct to the
writer&rsquo;s knowledge, had hung round it some wild traditions
not unlike &ldquo;Blind Willie&rsquo;s Story&rdquo; in
&ldquo;Redgauntlet.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt, now, all these things
have, to a considerable extent, disappeared,&mdash;although there
are wild <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>nooks, far wilder than any we have in England, where the
faith in the old superstitions lingers.&nbsp; In the great
preaching days, those men who shook the hearts of the thousands
of their listeners, as they dealt with unseen terrors, believed
themselves to be&mdash;as it was believed of them that they
were&mdash;covered with the shadow of an Unseen Hand, and
surrounded by the guardianship of the old Hebrew
prophet&mdash;&ldquo;chariots of fire, and horses of fire;&rdquo;
they believed themselves to be the care of a special Providence;
and some of the stories then current would only move the contempt
of that modern intelligence which has, at any rate, laid all the
ghosts.</p>
<p>It is not within the province of this volume to recapitulate
and classify Welsh superstitions; they were, and probably, in
many neighbourhoods, are still, very various: we must satisfy our
readers with a slight illustration.&nbsp; Perhaps some may object
to the retailing such stories, for instance, as the
following.&nbsp; The apology for its insertion, then, must be,
that it is one of a number tending to illustrate that sense which
the old Welsh mind had, of its residence upon the borders of, and
relation to, the Invisible World.&nbsp; The Rev. John Jones, of
Holywell, in Flintshire, was one of the most renowned ministers
in the Principality; he was a man of extraordinary zeal and
fervour as a preacher, and his life and character were, in
unblemished reputation, equal to his gifts and zeal.&nbsp; He
used to recite, with peculiar solemnity, a story of a mysterious
horseman, by whom he believed he had been delivered from a
position of extreme danger, when he was travelling, alone, from
Bala, in Merionethshire, to Machynlleth, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>in the county
of Montgomery.&nbsp; He travelled on horseback through a wild,
desolate country, at that time almost uninhabited; he had
performed nearly half his journey, when, as he was emerging from
a wood, he says, &ldquo;I observed coming towards me a man on
foot.&nbsp; By his appearance, judging from the sickle which he
carried sheathed in straw over his shoulder, he was doubtless a
reaper in search of employment.&nbsp; As he drew near, I
recognized a man whom I had seen at the door of the village inn
at Llanwhellyn, where I had stopped to bait my horse.&nbsp; On
our meeting, he touched his hat, and asked if I could tell him
the time of day.&nbsp; I pulled out my watch for the
purpose,&mdash;noticing, at the same time, the peculiar look
which the man cast at its heavy silver case.&nbsp; Nothing else,
however, occurred to excite any suspicion on my part; so, wishing
him a good afternoon, I continued my journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
must condense Mr. Jones&rsquo;s narration, feeling that the story
loses much of its graphic strength in so doing.&nbsp; He pursued
his way down a hill, and, at some distance farther on, noticed
something moving on the other side of a large hedge; he soon
discovered it to be a man, running in a stooping position.&nbsp;
He watched the figure with curiosity, which grew into something
like fear as he recognized the reaper with whom he had spoken a
short time before, and that, as he moved on, he was engaged in
tearing the straw band from his sickle.&nbsp; The man hurried on,
and Mr. Jones saw him conceal himself behind a thicker part of
the hedge, within a few yards of the road, and near where a gate
crossed the park.&nbsp; Mr. Jones says he did not doubt, then,
that he intended to attack and, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>perhaps, murder him for the sake of
the watch, and whatever money he might have about him.&nbsp; He
looked round: no other person was in sight,&mdash;no house near;
he was hemmed in by rocky banks and high hedges on either
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not turn back,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;my
business was of the utmost importance to the cause for which I
was journeying.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not urge his horse with
speed, for the gate was not open through which he had to pass; he
felt that he was weak and unarmed, and had no chance against a
powerful man with a dangerous weapon in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
despair,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;rather than in a spirit of humble
trust and confidence, I bowed my head, and offered up a silent
prayer.&nbsp; At this juncture, my horse, growing impatient of
delay, started off.&nbsp; I clutched the reins, which I had let
fall on his neck,&mdash;when, happening to turn my eyes, I saw,
to my utter astonishment, that I was no longer alone: there, by
my side, I beheld a horseman, in a dark dress, mounted on a white
steed.&nbsp; In intense amazement, I gazed upon him.&nbsp; Where
could he have come from?&nbsp; He appeared as suddenly as if he
had sprung from the earth; he must have been riding behind, and
have overtaken me,&mdash;and yet I had not heard the slightest
sound.&nbsp; It was mysterious, inexplicable; but joy overcame my
feelings of wonder, and I began at once to address my
companion.&nbsp; I asked him if he had seen any one; and then
described to him what had taken place, and how relieved I felt by
his sudden appearance.&nbsp; He made no reply, and, on looking at
his face, he seemed paying but slight attention to my words, but
continued intently gazing in the direction of the <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>gate,&mdash;now about a quarter of a mile ahead.&nbsp; I
followed his gaze, and saw the reaper emerge from his
concealment, and run across a field to our left, resheathing his
sickle as he hurried along.&nbsp; He had evidently seen that I
was no longer alone, and had relinquished his intended
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones sought to enter into conversation with his
mysterious companion, but he gave him no word in reply.&nbsp; He
says he &ldquo;was hurt at his companion&rsquo;s mysterious
silence;&rdquo; only once did he hear his voice.&nbsp; Having
watched the figure of the reaper disappear over the brow of a
neighbouring hill, he turned to the stranger, and said,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Can it for a moment be doubted that my prayer was
heard, and that you were sent for my deliverance by the
Lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then it was that I thought I heard the
horseman speak, and that he uttered the single word,
&lsquo;Amen!&rsquo;&nbsp; Not another word did he give utterance
to, though I spoke to him both in English and Welsh.&nbsp; We
were now approaching the gate, which I hastened to open; and
having done so, I waited at the side of the road for him to pass
through,&mdash;but he came not.&nbsp; I turned my head to look;
the mysterious horseman was gone; he was not to be seen; he had
disappeared as mysteriously as he had come.&nbsp; What could have
become of him?&nbsp; He could not have gone through the gate, nor
have made his horse leap the high hedges, which on both sides
shut in the road.&nbsp; Where was he? had I been dreaming? was it
an apparition, a spectre, which had been riding by my side for
the last ten minutes?&mdash;was it but a creature of my
imagination?&nbsp; I tried hard to convince myself that this was
the case; but why had the <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>reaper resheathed his
murderous-looking sickle and fled?&nbsp; And then, a feeling of
profound awe began to creep over my soul.&nbsp; I remembered the
singular way of his first appearance,&mdash;his long silence, and
the single word to which he had given utterance after I had
mentioned the name of the Lord; the single occasion on which I
had done so.&nbsp; What could I, then, believe, but that my
prayer had been heard, and that help had been given me at a time
of great danger?&nbsp; I dismounted, and throwing myself on my
knees, I offered up my thankfulness to Him who had heard my
cry.&nbsp; I then mounted my horse, and continued my journey; but
through the long years that have elapsed since that memorable
summer&rsquo;s day, I have never for a moment wavered in my
belief, that in the mysterious horseman I had a special
interference of Providence, by which I was delivered from a
position of extreme danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, however our readers may account for such incidents, the
only purpose in introducing such a story here, is to say that it
gives a fair illustration of that peculiar cast of ideal
imagination which pervaded the Welsh mind, and influenced at once
the impressions both of preachers and hearers.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, no other spot on our British soil where
&ldquo;the old order&rdquo; has so suddenly &ldquo;changed&rdquo;
as in Wales: the breaking open the mountains for mining purposes
has led to the thronging of dense populations on spots which
were, only a few years since, unbroken solitudes.&nbsp; Ruins,
which the sentimental idler never visited, wrecks of castles and
abbeys crumbling into dust, isolated places through which we
passed thirty years since, which seemed as <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>though they
never could be invaded by the railway whistle, or scarcely
reached by the penny postman, now lie on the great highway of the
train.&nbsp; It is not saying too much to affirm that there is no
spot in Europe where the traveller is so constantly brought into
the neighbourhood of old magnificence, the relics of vanished
cities.</p>
<p>The wonder grows as to what was the state of ancient society
in Wales.&nbsp; An eminent traveller says: &ldquo;In England our
ancestors have left us, dispersed in various places, splendid
remains of their greatness; but in Wales you cannot travel ten
miles without coming upon some vestige of antiquity which in
another country you would go fifty to trace out.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is of such spots that a Welsh poet, Dyer, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
pilgrim oft,<br />
At dead of night, &rsquo;mid his orisons hears,<br />
Aghast, the voice of Time disparting towers,<br />
Tumbling all precipitate, all down-dashed,<br />
Rattling around, loud thundering to the moon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an illustration of this is St. David&rsquo;s!&mdash;a
little miserable village, with the magnificent remains of its
great palace, and the indications of its once splendid cathedral;
itself now a kind of suffragan, it once numbered seven suffragans
within its metropolitan pale&mdash;Worcester, Hereford, Llandaff,
Bangor, St. Asaph, Llanbadarn, and Margam.&nbsp; The mitre now
dimly beaming at almost the lowest step of the ecclesiastical
ladder, once shone with so proud a lustre as to attract the
loftiest ecclesiastics.&nbsp; St. David&rsquo;s numbers one
saint, three lord-treasurers, one lord privy-seal, one chancellor
of Oxford, one chancellor <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>of England, and, in Farrar, one
illustrious martyr.</p>
<p>Travel through the country, and similar reflections will meet
you in every direction.&nbsp; You step a little off the
high-road, and&mdash;as, for instance, in Kilgerran&mdash;you
come to the traditional King Arthur&rsquo;s castle, the far-famed
Welsh Tintagel, of which Warton sings,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stately the feast, and high the cheer,<br
/>
Girt with many an arm&egrave;d peer,<br />
And canopied with golden pall,<br />
Amid Kilgerran&rsquo;s castle hall;<br />
Illumining the vaulted roof,<br />
A thousand torches flamed aloof;<br />
The storied tapestry was hung,<br />
With minstrelsy the arches rung,<br />
Of harps that with reflected light<br />
From the proud gallery glittered bright.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, in the neighbourhood of the magnificent coast of
Pembrokeshire, the wondrous little chapel of St. Govan&rsquo;s,
the hermitage of the hundred steps; and those splendid wrecks of
castles, Manopear, the home of Giraldus Cambrensis, and the
graceful and almost interminable recesses of Carew.&nbsp; A
traveller may plunge about among innumerable villages bearing the
names of saints for whom he will look in vain in the Romish
calendar,&mdash;St. Athan&rsquo;s, St. Siebald&rsquo;s, St.
Dubric&rsquo;s, St. Dogmael&rsquo;s, St. Ishmael&rsquo;s, and
crowds besides.&nbsp; All such places are girdled round with
traditions and legends known to Welsh
arch&aelig;ologists&mdash;the very nomenclature of Wales
involving poetry and historical romance, and often deep
tragedy.&nbsp; The names of the villages have a whisper of
fabulous <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>and traditional times, and are like the half-effaced
hieroglyphs upon an old Egyptian tomb.&nbsp; There is the
<i>Fynnon Waedog</i> (Bloody Well), <i>the Pald of Gwaye</i> (the
Hollow of Woe), the <i>Maen Achwynfan</i>, (the Stone of
Lamentation and Weeping), the <i>Leysan Gwaed Gwyr</i> (the Plant
of the Blood of Man), <i>Merthyr Tydvil</i> is the Martyred
Tydvil.&nbsp; Villages and fields with names like these, remind
us of the Hebrew names of places, really significant of some
buried tragedy, long holding its place in the heart, and terror
of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In a land-locked solitude like that of Nevern,
Cardiganshire,&mdash;where, by-the-bye, we might loiter some time
to recite some anecdotes of its admirable clergyman and great
preacher, one of the Griffiths,&mdash;the wanderer, after a piece
of agreeable wildness, comes to a village, enchanting for its
beauty, lying on the brink of a charming river, with indications
of a decayed importance; the venerable yew-trees of its
churchyard shadowing over a singular&mdash;we may venture to
speak of it as a piece of inexplicable&mdash;Runic antiquity, in
a stone of a quadrangular form, about two feet broad, eighteen
inches thick, and thirteen feet high, with a cross at the
top.&nbsp; Few countries can boast, like Wales, the charm of
places in wildest and most delicious scenery, with all that can
stir an artist&rsquo;s, poet&rsquo;s, or antiquarian&rsquo;s
sensibility.&nbsp; What a neighbourhood is Llandilo!&mdash;the
home of the really great poet, John Dyer, the author of
&ldquo;Grongar Hill,&rdquo; a delicious spot in this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Here, too, is Golden Grove, the retreat of
our own Jeremy Taylor; and here, in his days of exile, many of
the matchless sermons of him who has <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>been called, by some, &ldquo;the
English Chrysostom,&rdquo; and, by others, the &ldquo;Milton of
the English pulpit,&rdquo; were preached.&nbsp; We made a
pilgrimage there ourselves some few years since, urged by love to
the memory of Jeremy Taylor.&nbsp; We found the old church gone,
and in its place a new one,&mdash;the taste of which did not
particularly impress us; and we inquired for Taylor&rsquo;s
pulpit, and were told it had been chopped up for fire-wood!&nbsp;
Then we inquired for a path through the fields, which for a
hundred and fifty years had been called &ldquo;Taylor&rsquo;s
Walk,&rdquo; where the great bishop was wont to
meditate,&mdash;and found it had been delivered over to the
plough.&nbsp; We hope we may be forgiven if we say, that we
hurried in disgust from a village which, in spite of its new
noble mansion, had lost to us its chief charm.&nbsp; But this
neighbourhood, with its Dynevor Castle and its charming river,
the Towey, and all the scenery described by the exquisite Welsh
poet, in whose verse beauty and sublimity equally reign, compels
us to feel that if he somewhat pardonably over-coloured, by his
own associations, the lovely shrine of his birth, he only
naturally described the country through which these preachers
wandered, when he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>The manners of the people, a few years since, were as singular
and primeval as their country; in all the villages there were
singular usages.&nbsp; The &ldquo;biddings&rdquo; to their
weddings,&mdash;which have, perhaps, yielded to advanced good
taste,&mdash;had a sweeter relief in other customs, at weddings
and funerals, tending to civilize, and refine.&nbsp; Throughout
Glamorganshire, especially, and not many years since, it was the
universal custom, when young unmarried persons died, to strew the
way to the grave with sweet flowers and evergreens.&nbsp; Mr.
Malkin, in his interesting work on South Wales, published now
seventy years since, says: &ldquo;There is in the world an
unfeeling kind of false philosophy, which will treat such customs
as I mention with ridicule; but what can be more affecting than
to see all the youth of both sexes in a village, and in every
village through which the corpse passes, dressed in their best
apparel, and strewing with sweet-scented flowers the ways along
which one of their beloved neighbours was carried to his, or her
last home?&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt such customs are very much
changed, but they were prevalent during that period to which most
of those preachers whose manners we have mentioned belonged.</p>
<p>Such pathetic usages, indicating a simple state of society,
are commonly associated, as we have seen, with others of a
rougher kind and character.&nbsp; The Welsh preachers were the
pioneers of civilization,&mdash;although advanced society might
still think much had to be done in the amelioration of the
national manners.&nbsp; They probably touched a few practices
which were really in themselves simple and affecting, but they <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>swept away
many superstitions, quite destroyed many rude and degrading
practices, and introduced many usages, which, while they were in
conformity with the national instincts of the people (such as
preaching and singing, and assembling themselves together in
large companies), tended to refine and elevate the mind and
heart.</p>
<p>Such were the circumstances, and such the scenery, in which
the great Welsh preachers arose.</p>
<p>We have not thought of those Welsh preachers who have made
themselves especially known in England.&nbsp; Many have, from
time to time, settled as pastors with us, who have deserved a
large amount of our esteem and honour, blending in their minds
high reverence, the tender sensitiveness of a poetic imagination,
with the instinct of philosophic inquisitiveness&mdash;even
shading off into an order of scepticism,&mdash;but all united to
a strong and impressive eloquence.&nbsp; These attributes seem
all essentially to adhere in the character of the cultured Welsh
preacher.&nbsp; Caleb Morris finely illustrates all this; perhaps
he was no whit inferior, in the build and architecture of his
mind, to Horace Bushnell, whom he greatly resembled; but, unlike
Bushnell, he never committed any of his soliloquies of thought,
or feeling to the press.&nbsp; The present writer possesses
volumes of his reported sermons which have never seen the
light.</p>
<p>And what a Welshman was Rowland Williams!&nbsp; Who can read
his life without feeling the spirit of devotion, however languid,
inflamed and fired?&nbsp; And how, in spite of all the heresies
attributed to him, and, growing up in the midst of the sacred
ardours of <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>his character, we find illustrated the wonder of the
curious and searching eye, united to the warmth of the tender and
revering heart!&mdash;attributes, we repeat, which seemed to
mingle in very inferior types of Welsh preachers, as well as in
the more eminent, and which, as they kindle into a passion in the
man&rsquo;s nature who desires to instruct his fellow-men,
combine to make preaching, if they be absent, an infamy, a
pastime, a day labour, or a handicraft, an art or a science; or,
by their presence, constitute it a virtue and a mighty power over
human souls.&nbsp; Eminently these men seem to hear a voice
saying, &ldquo;<i>The prophet that hath a dream</i>, <i>let him
tell a dream</i>!&nbsp; <i>What is the chaff to the wheat</i>?
<i>saith the Lord</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christmas Evans is not the first, in point of time, in the
remarkable procession of those men whose names we might mention,
and of whom we shall find occasion in this volume to speak, as
the great Welsh preachers.&nbsp; And there may be some dispute as
to whether he was the first in point of eminence; but he is
certainly the one of the four whose name is something more than a
tradition.&nbsp; John Elias, Williams of Wern, and Davies of
Swansea, have left behind them little beside the legendary rumour
of their immense and pathetic power.&nbsp; This is true,
especially, of David Davies of Swansea; and yet, Dr. Rees, his
successor, and a very competent authority, says: &ldquo;In some
respects he was superior to all his distinguished
contemporaries.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>But the name of Christmas Evans is,
perhaps, the most extensively known of any,&mdash;just as the
name of Bunyan has a far more extensive intimacy than the equally
honourable names of Barrow and Butler; and there is a similar
reason for this.&nbsp; Christmas Evans, in the pulpit, more
nearly approached the great Dreamer than any pulpit master of
whom we have heard; many of his sermons appear to have been
long-sustained parables, and pictures alive with allegorical
delineation of human character.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Christmas Evans</span> was born at a place
called Esgairwen (Ysgarwen), in the parish of Llandysul, in
Cardiganshire; he was born on Christmas Day&mdash;and hence his
Christian name&mdash;in 1766.&nbsp; His parents, Samuel and
Johanna Evans, were in the poorest circumstances; his father was
a shoemaker, and although this profession has included such a
number of men remarkable for their genius and high attainments,
it has never found the masters of the craft greatly remarkable
for the possession of gold or gear.&nbsp; His mother, by her
maiden name Lewis, came from a respectable family of freeholders
in the parish; but the father of Christmas died when he was a
child,&mdash;and these were hard days of poverty, almost
destitution, for the poor struggling widow and her
family,&mdash;so her brother, James Lewis, of Bwlchog, in the
parish of Llanfihangel-ar-Arth, took little Christmas home to his
farm, engaging to feed and clothe him for such labour on the farm
as the poor boy might be able to perform.&nbsp; Here he stayed
six years,&mdash;six miserable years; his uncle was a hard, cruel
man, a selfish drunkard.&nbsp; Christmas used to <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>say of him,
in after years, &ldquo;It would be difficult to find a more
unconscionable man than James Lewis in the whole course of a
wicked world.&rdquo;&nbsp; During these, which ought to have been
the most valuable years of his life, no care was taken of his
heart, his mind, or his morals; in fact, he had neither a friend
nor a home.&nbsp; At the age of seventeen he could not read a
word, he was surrounded by the worst of examples, and he became
the subject of a number of serious accidents, through which he
narrowly escaped with his life.&nbsp; Once he was stabbed in a
quarrel, once he was nearly drowned, and with difficulty
recovered; once he fell from a high tree with an open knife in
his hand, and once a horse ran away with him, passing at full
speed through a low and narrow passage.&nbsp; There is an
erroneous impression that, in those days, he was a great boxer,
and that he lost his eye in a fight; the truth is quite
different; he was not a boxer, and never fought a battle in his
life.&nbsp; He lost his eye after his conversion, when he and
some other young men were attempting the work of mutual help, in
making up for lost time, by evening meetings, for various works
of instruction; a number of his former companions waylaid him at
night, beat him unmercifully, and one struck him with a stick
over the eye.&nbsp; In after years, when some one was jesting
before Robert Hall at Welsh preachers, upon his mentioning
Christmas Evans, the jester said, &ldquo;And he only has one
eye!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but
that&rsquo;s a piercer; an eye, sir, that could light an army
through a wilderness in a dark night.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that in his
sightless eye, Christmas Evans, like the one-eyed <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Spiridion,
the noble witness in the Nicean Council, really &ldquo;bore in
his body a mark of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we are
anticipating.</p>
<p>At about seventeen years of age, he left his bad uncle and his
more servile employments; still continuing the occupation of a
farming lad, he went to Glanclettwr; afterwards he lived at
Penyralltfawr, at Gwenawlt, and then at Castellhywel.&nbsp; Thus
the days of his youth passed; he looks like a poor, neglected,
and forsaken lad.&nbsp; Of books he knew nothing,&mdash;he had no
men of intelligence around him with whom to converse, and his
condition in life doomed him to association with all that was low
and brutal.&nbsp; And yet, strange as it may seem, as his friend
and earliest biographer, Mr. Rhys Stephen, has testified, even
then, as in the instance of the rugged young Samson, &ldquo;the
Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
not credible that, however crushed down beneath the weight of
such abject circumstances, the boy could have been exactly what
the other boys and men round him were; restless feelings, and
birth-throes of emotion and thought, make themselves known in
most of us before they assume a shape in consciousness: it is
natural that it should have been so with him.&nbsp; With a life
of seriousness, which resulted in Church membership, and which
appears to have taken place when he was about seventeen years of
age, commenced his life of mental improvement,&mdash;the first
humble beginnings of intellectual effort.&nbsp; It is singular
that the Church with which he first united, at Llwynrhydowain,
originally Presbyterian, and of considerable importance in the
early history of Welsh Nonconformity, approached very nearly,
when Evans <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>united with it, to Unitarianism.&nbsp; Its pastor was
the Rev. David Davies; he was an Arian, an eminent bard, a
scholar, an admirable and excellent man, who has left behind him
a very honourable reputation.&nbsp; Such a man as Mr. Davies was,
he would be likely to be interested in the intelligent and
intellectual state of the youth of his Church and
congregation.&nbsp; The slight accounts we possess of the avidity
with which Christmas Evans and his companions commenced their
&ldquo;pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,&rdquo; is very
animating and pleasing; they combined together with the desire to
obtain the earliest and most necessary means of mental
acquisitiveness, such as reading and writing, a desire for the
acquisition of religious knowledge, and what may be spoken of as
some of the higher branches of study.&nbsp; But we will employ
Christmas Evans&rsquo;s own words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During a revival which took place in the
Church under the care of Mr. David Davies, many young people
united themselves with that people, and I amongst them.&nbsp;
What became of the major part of these young converts, I have
never known; but I hope God&rsquo;s grace followed them as it did
me, the meanest of the whole.&nbsp; One of the fruits of this
awakening was the desire for religious knowledge that fell upon
us.&nbsp; Scarcely one person out of ten could, at this time, and
in those neighbourhoods, read at all, even in the language of the
country.&nbsp; We bought Bibles and candles, and were accustomed
to meet together in the evening, in the barn of Penyralltfawr;
and thus, in about one month, I was able to read the Bible in my
mother tongue.&nbsp; I was vastly delighted with so much
learning.&nbsp; This, however, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>did not satisfy me, but I borrowed
books, and learnt a little English.&nbsp; Mr. Davies, my pastor,
understood that I thirsted for knowledge, and took me to his
school, where I stayed for six months.&nbsp; Here I went through
the Latin Grammar; but so low were my circumstances that I could
stay there no longer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To preach, as we all know, has often been an object of
ambition with young converts, and the novices in the vestibule of
knowledge of the spiritual life; such an ambition seems very
early to have stirred in the heart of young Christmas.&nbsp; We
have already mentioned how it was that he so cruelly lost the use
of an eye; it illustrates the singular brutality of the time and
neighbourhood; an inoffensive lad, simply because he renounced
the society of profane drunkards, and was laudably busying
himself with the affairs of a higher life, was set upon in the
darkness of the night by six young ruffians, unmercifully beaten
with sticks, and the sight of an eye destroyed.&nbsp; It was the
night after this calamity that he had a dream; and the dream of
the night reveals the bent of his day dreams.&nbsp; He dreamt
that the Day of Judgment was come, that he saw the world in a
blaze; with great confidence he called out, &ldquo;Jesus, save
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he thought he saw the Lord turn towards him
and say, &ldquo;It was thy intention to preach the Gospel, but it
is now too late, for the Day of Judgment is come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But this vision of the night clung to him when he awoke; perhaps
he feared that the loss of the eye would interfere with his
acceptance as a minister.&nbsp; Certainly the dream had an
influence on his future career,&mdash;so had many other
dreams.&nbsp; It was always his belief that he had received <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>some of his
most important impressions from dreams: nothing, apparently, no
amount of reason or argument, could persuade him to the
contrary.&nbsp; To preach the Gospel became an ardent desire now
with this passionately imaginative and earnest youth; but there
were serious hindrances in the way.&nbsp; There appears to have
been a kind of law in the Church with which he was connected at
Llwynrhydowain, that no member of the Church should be permitted
to preach until he had passed through a college course.&nbsp; It
is very remarkable that two of the greatest preachers who have
adorned the pulpit of Wales should have been admitted into Church
fellowship together on the same evening,&mdash;David Davies,
afterwards of Swansea, whose name we have already mentioned, and
Christmas Evans.&nbsp; It was always the regret and complaint of
their first pastor, that the Church law to which we have
referred, deprived his Church of the two most eminent men it had
ever produced.&nbsp; There were, no doubt, other reasons; but it
is singular, now, to notice the parallelism of the gifted pair,
for they also preached their first sermon, within a week of each
other, in the same cottage.&nbsp; Cottage preaching was then of
much more importance than it now seems to our ecclesiastical and
&aelig;sthetic apprehensions; and the congregations which
assembled in those old Welsh cottages were such as to try the
mental and spiritual strength of a young preacher.&nbsp; How
Davies acquitted himself, and how he ran his course, we may
notice by-and-bye; our present concern is with Christmas
Evans.&nbsp; Perhaps our readers will not entertain a
depreciating opinion of the youth, when they hear him very
candidly confess that the substance <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of his first sermon was taken from
Beveridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thesaurus Theologicus,&rdquo; a book
borrowed, probably, from his pastor.&nbsp; But a Mr. Davies, who
must have been a reading man although a farmer, heard it, was
very much impressed by it, but went home and found it; so that
the poor boy&rsquo;s reputation as a preacher seemed gone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;I have some hope
of the son of Samuel the shoemaker, because the prayer was as
good as the sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; But perhaps he would not have
thought so hopefully of the young man had he then known, what
Christmas afterwards confessed, that the prayer, too, was very
greatly committed to memory from a collection of prayers by a
well-known clergyman, Griffith Jones of Llanddowror.</p>
<p>Such was the first public effort of this distinguished
preacher; like the first effort of his great English
contemporary, Robert Hall, we suppose it would be regarded as a
failure.&nbsp; Meantime, we have to notice that the spiritual
life of the youth was going on; he began to be dissatisfied with
the frame of theologic sentiment of the Church to which he
belonged.&nbsp; He heard preachers who introduced him to the more
grand, scriptural, and evangelical views of Christian
truth.&nbsp; The men of that time did not play at preaching; the
celebrated David Morris, father of the yet more celebrated
Ebenezer Morris; the great Peter Williams, Jones of Llangan,
Thomas Davies of Neath,&mdash;such men as these appear to have
kindled in his mind loftier views of the person and the work of
Christ.&nbsp; Also, a man named Amos, who had been a member of
the same Church with Christmas Evans, had left that communion, <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and joined
that of the Baptists.&nbsp; A close study of the Word of God led
Christmas also to a change of convictions as to the meaning and
importance of the rite of baptism.&nbsp; A similar change of
theologic opinion was passing through the mind of his young
friend and fellow-member, David Davies, who finally united
himself with the Independent communion.&nbsp; Christmas Evans
says, &ldquo;I applied to the Baptist Church at Aberduar, where I
was in due time received; I was then about twenty years and six
months old.&nbsp; I was baptized by the Rev. Timothy
Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the names of successive persons and pastors pass before our
eyes, and appear in these pages, it is at once affecting,
humbling, and elevating, to think of men of whom our ears have
scarcely ever heard, but who, in their day, were men &ldquo;of
whom the world was not worthy,&rdquo; and whose &ldquo;record is
now on high.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a man, beyond all question, was
this Timothy Thomas, the son of an eminent father, the brother of
men who, if not as eminent as himself, were yet worthy of the
noble relationship.&nbsp; He was a Welsh gentleman, lived on a
farm, an extended lease of which he held, and which enabled him
to preach and fulfil the work of a pastor without any monetary
reward.&nbsp; He appears to have devoted himself, his time, his
energy, and his property to the work of the ministry.&nbsp; His
farm was a splendid one in the vale of the Teivy.&nbsp; Mr. Rhys
Stephen, who knew him, speaks of his gallant bearing, his
ingenuous spirit, and of his princely magnanimity; he would ride
thirty or forty miles on a Saturday, through the remote wilds of
Caermarthenshire and Cardiganshire, to be ready for the services
on the Sunday.&nbsp; His <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>gentlemanly bearing overcame and beat
down mobs which sometimes assembled for the purpose of insulting
and assailing him.&nbsp; Mr. Stephen mentions one singular
instance, when Mr. Thomas was expected to administer the
ordinance of baptism, and, as was not unusual in those days, in
the natural baptistry of the river.&nbsp; A mob had assembled
together for the purpose of insulting and annoying the service,
the missiles of offence in their hands; when, suddenly, a
well-dressed gentleman, mounted on a noble horse, rode over the
village bridge; he hastily alighted, gave his bridle to a
bystander, walked briskly into the middle of the little flock;
the inimical members of the mob set him down for a magistrate at
the least, and expected that he would give the word to disperse;
but instead of doing so, he took the nearest candidate by the
hand, and walked himself down into the stream, booted and spurred
as he was.&nbsp; Before the mob had done gaping, he had done this
part of his work; after this, however, he stood upon the brink of
the stream, still in his wet attire, and preached one of his
ardent sermons.&nbsp; He certainly conciliated the homage of the
opposing forces, and left them under the impression that the
&ldquo;dippers,&rdquo; as the Baptists were generally called, had
certainly one gentleman among them.&nbsp; We do not know how our
Baptist brethren would like to submit to this kind of service,
but it certainly seems to resemble more closely the baptism of
Enon, near to Salem, and that of the Ethiopian prince by Philip,
than some we have seen.</p>
<p>The anecdotes of this Timothy Thomas are too good and too
numerous to be entirely passed by.&nbsp; Once he was preaching in
the enchanting neighbourhood <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>near Llandeilo, to which we referred
in the first chapter&mdash;the neighbourhood of Grongar Hill, and
Golden Grove; the neighbourhood of Dyer, Steele, and Jeremy
Taylor.&nbsp; It was a still Sabbath morning in the summer, and
in that lovely spot immense crowds were gathered to hear
him.&nbsp; He had administered baptism, and preached, without
interruption, when someone came up to him and told him, with
startled fear and trepidation, that the clergyman,&mdash;the
rector,&mdash;on his way to the church, had been detained,
utterly unable to pass through the crowd, through the greater
part of the service.&nbsp; Instantly, with admirable tact and
catholicity, he exclaimed: &ldquo;I understand that the respected
clergyman of the parish has been listening patiently to me for
the last hour; let us all go to the church and return the
compliment by hearing him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church, and the
churchyard as well, were instantly crowded; the clergyman was
delighted with the catholic spirit displayed by the Baptist
minister, and of course not a word further was said about the
trespass which had been committed.</p>
<p>Timothy Thomas was a noble specimen of what has been called
the &ldquo;muscular Christian;&rdquo; he had great courage.&nbsp;
Once, when travelling with his wife, and set upon by four
ruffians, he instantly, with his single stick, floored two, but
broke his stick in the very act of conquest.&nbsp; Immediately he
flew to a hedge and tore up a prodigious stake, and was again
going forth to victory, when the scoundrels, having had enough of
this bishop of the Church militant, took to flight and left him
in undisputed possession of the field.&nbsp; A remarkable man
this,&mdash;a sort of Welsh <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>chieftain; a perfect gentleman, but
half farmer, half preacher.&nbsp; In the order of Church
discipline, a man was brought up before him, as the pastor, for
having knocked down an Unitarian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us hear all
about it,&rdquo; said the pastor.&nbsp; &ldquo;To tell all the
truth about it, sir,&rdquo; said the culprit, &ldquo;I met Jack
the miller at the sign of the Red Dragon, and there we had a
single glass of ale together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop a
bit,&rdquo; said the minister; &ldquo;I hope you paid for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is
in your favour, Thomas,&rdquo; said the pastor; &ldquo;I cannot
bear those people who go about tippling at other people&rsquo;s
expense.&nbsp; Go on, Thomas.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir,
after a little while we began quietly talking about religion, and
about the work of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Jack said that He was only
a man, and then he went on to say shocking things, things that it
was beyond the power of flesh and blood to bear.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; said the pastor; &ldquo;but what did he
say?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He actually said, sir, that the blood of
Christ had no more power in it than the blood of a beast.&nbsp; I
could not stand that any more, so I knocked him
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, brother,&rdquo; said the
minister, &ldquo;I cannot say that you did the right thing, but I
quite believe that I should have done so too.&nbsp; Go, and sin
no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But with all these marks of a strong character, the lines of
Timothy Thomas&rsquo;s faith were clear and firm.</p>
<p>Such was the man who received Christmas Evans into the Church
of which he became so bright and shining an ornament.&nbsp; This
noble man survived until his eighty-sixth year; he died at
Cardigan, in 1840.&nbsp; He was asked, sometimes, how many he had
baptized <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>during his lifetime, and he would reply, brusquely,
&ldquo;About two thousand;&rdquo; at other times, he would be
more particular, and say, &ldquo;I have baptized at least two
thousand persons.&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; he would add tenderly,
&ldquo;and thirty of them have become ministers of the Gospel;
and it was I who baptized Christmas Evans,&rdquo;&mdash;sometimes
adding na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;I did it right, too,&mdash;according
to the apostolic practice, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we are brought to the interesting and important
turning-point in the life of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; He had united
himself with the Baptist communion.&nbsp; Our readers will
clearly perceive, that he was a young man who could not be
hidden, and it was soon discovered that the work of the ministry
was to be his destination.&nbsp; As to his internal state, upon
which a ministerial character must always depend, these early
years of his religious life were times and seasons of great
spiritual depression.&nbsp; Such frames of feeling depend,
perhaps, not less, or more, upon certain aspects of religious
truth, than they do upon the peculiarities of temperament; a
nervous imagination is very exhausting, and brings the physical
frame very low; moreover, exalted ideas, and ideals, produce very
depressing appreciations of self.&nbsp; He thought himself a mass
of ignorance and sin; he desired to preach, but he thought that
such words as his must be useless to his hearers: then, as to the
method of preaching, he was greatly troubled.&nbsp; He thought by
committing his sermons to memory he forfeited the gift of the
Holy Spirit; so he says he changed his method, took a text
without any premeditation, and preached what occurred to him at
the time; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;if it was bad
before, it was worse now; so I <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>thought God would have nothing to do
with me as a preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was humbled; he entered every pulpit with dread;
he thought that he was such an one that his mere appearance in
the pulpit would be quite sufficient to becloud the hearts of his
hearers, and to intercept the light from heaven.&nbsp; Then it
seems he had no close friend to whom he could talk; he was afraid
lest, if he laid bare the secrets of his heart, he should seem to
be only a hypocrite; so he had to wrap up the bitter secrets of
his soul in his own heart, and drink of his bitter cup
alone.&nbsp; Is this experience singular?&nbsp; Is not this the
way in which all truly great, and original preachers have been
made?&mdash;Luther, Bunyan, Dr. Payson, Robert Hall,&mdash;how
many beside?&nbsp; Such men have attained high scholarships, and
fellowships, in the great university of human nature; like Peter,
pierced to the heart themselves, they have &ldquo;pricked&rdquo;
the hearts, the consciences, of the thousands who have heard
them.&nbsp; Thus, more than from the lore of classical
literatures, they have had given to them &ldquo;the tongue of the
learned,&rdquo; which has enabled them to speak &ldquo;a word in
season to those who were wearied;&rdquo; thus,
&ldquo;converted&rdquo; themselves, they have been able to
&ldquo;strengthen their brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evans passed through a painful experience; the young man was
feeling his way.&nbsp; He was unconscious of the powers within
him, although they were struggling for expression; and so,
through his humility and lowly conceptions of himself, he was
passing on to future eminence and usefulness.</p>
<p>Lleyn was the first place where he appears to <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>have felt his
feet.&nbsp; Lleyn at that time had not even the dignity of being
a village; it is a little inland hamlet out of Caernarvon Bay;
Nevin is its principal village; perhaps if the reader should seek
out Lleyn, even upon a tolerable map of Caernarvonshire, he will
have a difficulty in finding it.&nbsp; It seems to have been a
hamlet of the promontory, on a grand coast, surrounded by
magnificent hills, or overhanging mountains; we have never
visited it, but those who have done so speak of it as possessing
the charms of peculiar wildness: on the one side, precipitous
ravines, shut in by the sea; on the other, walls of dark
mountains,&mdash;forming the most complete picture of isolation
possible to imagine.&nbsp; Here is said to be the last
resting-place of Vortigern, who fled hither to escape the rage of
his subjects, excited by his inviting the Saxons to
Britain.&nbsp; A curious tradition holds that the mountains are
magnetic, and masters of vessels are said to be careful not to
approach too near the coast, fearing the effect upon their
compasses; this is believed to be the effect of a strong
undercurrent setting in all along the coast, dangerous to
vessels, and apt to lead them out of their course.&nbsp; Such was
Lleyn, the first field of labour on which this melancholy and
brooding youth was to exercise his ministry.</p>
<p>Evans had attended the Baptist Association at Maesyberllan in
Brecknockshire, in 1790; he was persuaded there to enter upon the
ministry in this very obscure district, and he was ordained as a
missionary to work among the humble Churches in that
vicinity.&nbsp; It does not appear that, in his own
neighbourhood, he had as yet attained to any reputation <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>for peculiar
power, or that there were any apparent auguries and
prognostications of his future usefulness.&nbsp; It is curious to
notice, almost so soon as he began his work in this his first
distinct field of labour, he appears like a man new made; for
this seems to have been the place where the burden of which
Bunyan speaks, rolled from this Christian&rsquo;s back; here a
new life of faith began to glow in him, and he knew something of
what it is to have the &ldquo;oil of joy for mourning, and the
garment of praise instead of the spirit of
heaviness.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little success is very encouraging;
depreciation is frequently the parent of depression; success is
often a fine old strengthening wine; and how often we have had
occasion to admire men who have wrought on at life&rsquo;s tasks
bravely and cheerfully, although success never came and sat down
by their side, to cheer and encourage them; one sometimes wonders
what they would have done had their efforts and words received
the garland and the crown.&nbsp; Well, perhaps not so much; these
things are more wisely ordered than we know.&nbsp; Only this also
may be remarked, that, perhaps, the highest order of mind and
heart can do almost as well without success as with
it,&mdash;will behave beautifully if success should come, will
behave no less beautifully even if success should never come.</p>
<p>At Lleyn, Christmas Evans tasted the first prelibations of a
successful ministry; a wondrous power attended his preaching,
numbers were gathered into the Church.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could
scarcely believe,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the testimony of the
people who came before the Church as candidates for membership,
that they were converted through my ministry; yet I was obliged
to <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>believe, though it was marvellous in my eyes.&nbsp; This
made me thankful to God, and increased my confidence in prayer; a
delightful gale descended upon me as from the hill of the New
Jerusalem, and I felt the three great things of the kingdom of
heaven, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, very unusual powers seemed to attend
him.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I frequently preached out of doors at
nightfall,&rdquo; and the singing, and the praising seem to have
touched him very tenderly; he frequently found his congregations
bathed in tears and weeping profusely.&nbsp; Preaching was now to
him, as he testifies, a very great pleasure,&mdash;and no wonder;
quite a remarkable revival of religious feeling woke up wherever
he went.&nbsp; When he first entered Lleyn, the religious life
was very cold and feeble; quite wonderful was the change.</p>
<p>After a time, exhausted with his work in these villages, he
accepted an invitation to visit the more remote parts of South
Wales.&nbsp; When ministers, like Christmas Evans, are enfeebled
in health, they recreate themselves by preaching; the young man
was enfeebled, but he started off on his preaching tour; he could
not obtain a horse, so he walked the whole way, preaching in
every village or town through which he passed.&nbsp; Very
frequently large numbers of the same congregation would follow
after him the next day, and attend the services fifteen or twenty
times, although many miles apart.&nbsp; So he went through the
counties of Cardigan, Pembroke, Caernarvon, Glamorgan, Monmouth,
and Brecknock, stopping and holding services at the innumerable
villages lying on his way.&nbsp; The fame that a wonderful man of
God <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>had
appeared spread through South Wales on the wings of the wind, and
an appointment for Christmas Evans to preach was sufficient to
attract thousands to the place.&nbsp; While he yet continued at
Lleyn as itinerant missionary, in that short time he had acquired
perhaps a greater popularity than any other preacher of that day
in Wales.</p>
<p>We have not said that, during the first years of his residence
at Lleyn, he married Catherine Jones, a young lady a member of
his own Church,&mdash;a pious girl, and regarded as in every way
suitable for his companion.&nbsp; It will be seen that, so far
from diminishing, it seemed rather to increase his ardour; he
frequently preached five times during the Sabbath, and walked
twenty miles; his heart appeared to be full of love, he spoke as
in the strains of a seraph.&nbsp; No wonder that such labour and
incessant excitement told upon his health, it was feared even
that he might sink into consumption; but surely it was a singular
cure suggested for such a disease, to start off on the preaching
tour we have described.</p>
<p>At last, however, in an unexpected moment, he became
great.&nbsp; It was at one of those wonderful gatherings, an
Association meeting, held at Velinvoel, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Llanelly.&nbsp; A great concourse of people were
assembled in the open air.&nbsp; There was some hitch in the
arrangements.&nbsp; Two great men were expected, but still some
one or other was wanted to break the ice&mdash;to prepare the
way.&nbsp; On so short a notice, notwithstanding the abundant
preaching power, no one was found willing to take the vacant
place.&nbsp; Christmas Evans was there, walking about on the edge
of the <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>crowd&mdash;a tall, bony, haggard young man, uncouth,
and ill-dressed.&nbsp; The master of the ceremonies for the
occasion, the pastor of the district, was in an agony of
perplexity to find his man,&mdash;one who, if not equal to the
mightiest, would yet be sufficient for the occasion.&nbsp; In his
despair, he went to our old friend, Timothy Thomas; but he,
declining for himself, said abruptly, &ldquo;Why not ask that
one-eyed lad from the North?&nbsp; I hear that he preaches quite
wonderfully.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the pastor went to him.&nbsp; He
instantly consented.&nbsp; Many who were there afterwards
expressed the surprise they felt at the communication going on
between the pastor and the odd-looking youth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;he can never ask that
absurdity to preach!&rdquo;&nbsp; They felt that an egregious
mistake was being committed; and some went away to refresh
themselves, and others to rest beneath the hedges around, until
the great men should come; and others, who stayed, comforted
themselves with the assurance that the &ldquo;one-eyed lad&rdquo;
would have the good sense to be very short.&nbsp; But, for the
young preacher, while he was musing, the fire was burning; he was
now, for the first time, to front one of those grand Welsh
audiences, the sacred <i>Eisteddfod</i> of which we have spoken,
and to be the preacher of an occasion, which, through all his
life after, was to be his constant work.&nbsp; Henceforth there
was to be, perhaps, not an Association meeting of his
denomination, of which he was not to be the most attractive
preacher, the most longed-for and brilliant star.</p>
<p>He took a grand text: &ldquo;And you, that were sometime
alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>works, yet
now hath He reconciled, in the body of His flesh, through death,
to present you holy, and unblamable, and unreprovable in His
sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Old men used to describe afterwards how he
justified their first fears by his stiff, awkward movements; but
the organ was, in those first moments, building, and soon it
began to play.&nbsp; He showed himself a master of the instrument
of speech.&nbsp; Closer and closer the audience began to gather
near him.&nbsp; They got up, and came in from the hedges.&nbsp;
The crowd grew more and more dense with eager listeners; the
sermon became alive with dramatic representation.&nbsp; The
throng of preachers present confessed that they were dazzled with
the brilliance of the language, and the imagery, falling from the
lips of this altogether unknown and unexpected young
prophet.&nbsp; Presently, beneath some appalling stroke of words,
numbers started to their feet; and in the pauses&mdash;if pauses
were permitted in the paragraphs&mdash;the question went,
&ldquo;Who is this? who have we here?&rdquo;&nbsp; His words went
rocking to and fro; he had caught the
&ldquo;<i>hwyl</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;he had also caught the people in
it; he went swelling along at full sail.&nbsp; The people began
to cry, &ldquo;<i>Gogoniant</i>!&rdquo; (Glory!)&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Bendigedig</i>!&rdquo; (Blessed!)&nbsp; The excitement
was at its highest when, amidst the weeping, and rejoicing of the
mighty multitude, the preacher came to an end.&nbsp; Drawn
together from all parts of Wales to the meeting, when they went
their separate ways home they carried the memory of &ldquo;the
one-eyed lad&rdquo; with them.</p>
<p>Christmas Evans was, from that moment, one of the most famous
preachers in the Principality.&nbsp; Lord <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Byron tells
us how he woke up one morning and found himself famous.&nbsp; In
those days, a new great Welsh preacher was quite as famous a
birth in the little country of Wales as the most famous
reputation could be in the literary world of England.</p>
<p>We can conceive it all; for, about thirty-five years since, we
were spectators of some such scene.&nbsp; It was far in the
depths of the dark mountains beyond Abersychan, that we were led
to a large Welsh service; but it was in a great chapel, and it
was on a winter&rsquo;s night.&nbsp; The place was dimly lit with
candles.&nbsp; There were, we remember, three preachers.&nbsp;
But whilst the first were pursuing their way, or the occasional
hymns were being chanted, our companion said to us, &ldquo;But I
want you to hear that little hump-backed man, behind there; he
will come next.&rdquo;&nbsp; We could scarcely see the little
hump-backed man, but what we saw of him did not predispose our
minds to any very favourable impressions, or prophecies of great
effects.&nbsp; In due time he came forward.&nbsp; Even as soon as
he presented himself, however, there was an evident
expectation.&nbsp; The people began more certainly to settle
themselves; to crane their necks forward; to smile their loving
smile, as upon a well-known friend, who would not disappoint
them; and to utter their sighs and grunts of satisfaction.&nbsp;
He was as uncouth a piece of humanity as we have ever seen, the
little hump-backed man, thin and bony.&nbsp; His iron-grey hair
fell over his forehead with no picturesque effect, nor did his
eyes seem to give any indication of fire; and there was a
shuffling and shambling in his gait, giving no sign of the grace
of the orator.&nbsp; But, gradually, as he moved along, and <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>before he had
moved far, the whole of that audience was subject to his spell of
speech.&nbsp; His hair was thrown back from his forehead; his
features were lighted up.&nbsp; Hump-backed!&nbsp; You neither
saw it, nor thought of it.&nbsp; His wiry movement seemed
informed by dignity and grandeur.&nbsp; First, there came forth
audible gaspings, and grunts of approval and pleasure.&nbsp; His
very accent, whether you knew his language or not, compelled
tears to start to the eyes.&nbsp; Forth came those devout
gushings of speech we have mentioned, which, in Wales, are the
acclamations which greet a preacher; and, like Christmas Evans
with the close of his first grand sermon, the little hump-backed
man sat down, victorious over all personal deformity, amidst the
weeping and rejoicing of the people.&nbsp; We have always thought
of that circumstance as a wonderful illustration of the power of
the mind over the body.</p>
<p>Christmas returned to Lleyn, but not to remain there
long.&nbsp; The period of his ministry in that neighbourhood was
about two years, and during that time the religious spirit of the
neighbourhood had been deeply stirred.&nbsp; It is most likely
that the immediate cause which led to his removal may be traced
to the natural feeling that he was fitted for a much more obvious
and extended field of labour.&nbsp; Lleyn was a kind of mission
station, its churches were small, they had long been
disorganised, and it was not likely that, even if they woke at
once into newness of life, they could attain to ideas of
liberality and Church order, on which the growth and advance and
perpetuity of the Churches could alone be founded; and then it
was very likely discovered that the man <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>labouring
among them would be demanded for labours very far afield; it is
awkward when the gifts of a man make him eminently acceptable to
shine and move as an evangelist, and yet he is expected to fill
the place, and be as steady in pastoral relations as a pole
star!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In 1792 Christmas Evans left Lleyn.&nbsp; He speaks of a
providential intimation conveyed to him from the Island of
Anglesea; the providential intimation was a call to serve all the
Churches of his order in that island for seventeen pounds a year!
and for the twenty years during which he performed this service,
he never asked for more.&nbsp; He was twenty-six years of age
when he set forth, on his birthday, Christmas Day, for his new
and enlarged world of work.&nbsp; He travelled like an
Apostle,&mdash;and surely he travelled in an apostolic
spirit,&mdash;he was unencumbered with this world&rsquo;s
goods.&nbsp; It was a very rough day of frost and snow,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The way was long, the wind was
cold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>He
travelled on horseback, with his wife behind him; and he arrived
on the evening of the same day at Llangefni.&nbsp; On his arrival
in Anglesea he found ten small Baptist Societies, lukewarm and
faint; what amount of life there was in them was spent in the
distraction of theological controversy, which just then appeared
to rage, strong and high, among the Baptists in North
Wales.&nbsp; He was the only minister amongst those Churches, and
he had not a brother minister to aid him within a hundred and
fifty miles; but he commenced his labours in real earnest, and
one of his first movements was to appoint a day of fasting and
prayer in all the preaching places; he soon had the satisfaction
to find a great revival, and it may with truth be said &ldquo;the
pleasure of the Lord prospered in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Llangefni appears to have been the spot in Anglesea where
Christmas found his home.&nbsp; Llangefni is a respectable town
now; when the preaching apostle arrived there, near a hundred
years since, its few scattered houses did not even rise to the
dignity of a village.&nbsp; Cildwrn Chapel was here the place of
his ministrations, and here stood the little cottage where
Christmas and his wife passed their plain and simple days.&nbsp;
Chapel and cottage stood upon a bleak and exposed piece of
ground.&nbsp; The cottage has been reconstructed since those
days, but upon the site of the queer and quaint old manse stands
now a far more commodious chapel-keeper&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; As
in the Bedford vestry they show you still the chair in which John
Bunyan sat, so here they show a venerable old chair, Christmas
Evans&rsquo;s chair, in the old Cildwrn cottage; it is deeply and
curiously <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>marked by the cuttings of his pocket-knife, made when he
was indulging in those reveries and daydreams in which he lived
abstracted from everything around him.</p>
<p>The glimpses of life we obtain from this old Cildwrn cottage
do not incline us to speak in terms of very high eulogy of the
Voluntary principle, as developed in Anglesea in that day; from
the description, it must have been a very poor shanty, or windy
shieling; it is really almost incredible to think of such a man
in such a home.&nbsp; The stable for the horse or pony was a part
of the establishment, or but very slightly separated from it; the
furniture was very poor and scanty: a bed will sometimes
compensate for the deprivations and toils of the day when the
wearied limbs are stretched upon it, but Christmas Evans could
not, as James Montgomery has it, &ldquo;Stretch the tired limbs,
and lay the head, upon his own delightful bed;&rdquo; for, one of
his biographers says, the article on which the inmates, for some
time after their settlement, rested at night, could be designated
a bed only by courtesy; some of the boards having given way, a
few stone slabs did some necessary service.&nbsp; The door by
which the preacher and his wife entered the cottage was rotted
away, and the economical congregation saved the expense of a new
door by nailing a tin plate across the bottom; the roof was so
low that the master of the house, when he stood up, had to
exercise more than his usual forethought and precaution.</p>
<p>Here, then, was the study, the furnace, forge, and anvil
whence were wrought out those noble ideas, images, words, which
made Christmas Evans a <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>household name throughout the entire
Principality.&nbsp; Here he, and his Catherine, passed their days
in a life of perfect naturalness&mdash;somewhat too natural,
thinks the reader&mdash;and elevated piety.&nbsp; Which of us,
who write, or read these pages, will dare to visit them with the
indignity of our pity?&nbsp; Small as his means were, he looks
very happy, with his pleasant, bright, affectionate, helpful and
useful wife; he grew in the love and honour of the people; and to
his great pulpit eminence, and his simple daily life, have been
applied, not unnaturally, the fine words of Wordsworth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So did he travel on life&rsquo;s common
way<br />
In cheerful lowliness; and yet his heart<br />
The mightiest duties on itself did lay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there was a period in Wordsworth&rsquo;s life, before
place, and fame, and prosperity came to him, when the little
cottage near the Wishing Gate, in Grasmere, was not many steps
above that of the Cildwrn cottage of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; The
dear man did not care about his poverty,&mdash;he appears never
either to have attempted to conceal it, nor to grumble at it; and
one of his biographers applies to him the pleasant words of Jean
Paul Richter, &ldquo;The pain of poverty was to him only as the
piercing of a maiden&rsquo;s ear, and jewels were hung in the
wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, no doubt, a very rough life, but he appears to have
attained to the high degree of the Apostle,&mdash;&ldquo;having
food and raiment, let us be therewith content;&rdquo; and he was
caught up, and absorbed in his work: sermons, and material for
sermons, were always preparing in his mind; he lived to preach,
to <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>exercise that bardic power of his.&nbsp; That poor room
was the study; he had no separate room to which to retire, where,
in solitude, he could stir, or stride the steeds of thought or
passion.</p>
<p>During those years, in that poor Cildwrn room, he mastered
some ways of scholarship, the mention of which may, perhaps,
surprise some of our readers.&nbsp; He made himself a fair
Hebraist; no wonder at that, he must have found the language, to
him, a very congenial tongue; we take it that, anyhow, the
average Welshman will much more readily grapple with the
difficulties of Hebrew than the average Englishman.&nbsp; Then he
became so good a Grecian, that once, in a bookseller&rsquo;s
shop, upon his making some remarks on Homer in the presence of a
clergyman, a University man, which drew forth expressions of
contempt, Christmas put on his classical panoply, and so
addressed himself to the shallow scholar, that he was compelled,
by the pressure of engagements, to beat a surprisingly quick
retreat.</p>
<p>Very likely the slender accoutrements of his library would
create a sneer upon the lips of most of the scholars of the
modern pulpit: his lexicons did not rise above
Parkhurst,&mdash;and <i>we</i> will be bold to express gratitude
to that forgotten and disregarded old scholar, too; Owen supplied
him with the bones of theological thought, the framework of his
systematic theology; and whatever readers may think of his taste,
Dr. Gill largely drew upon his admiration and sympathy, in the
method of his exposition.&nbsp; But, when all was said and done,
he was the Vulcan himself, who wrought the splendid fancies of
the Achilles&rsquo; shield,&mdash;say, rather, of the shield of
Faith; <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>he
did not disdain books, but books with him were few, and his mind,
experience, and observation were large.</p>
<p>A little while ago, we heard a good story.&nbsp; A London
minister of considerable notoriety, never in any danger of being
charged with a too lowly estimate of himself, or his powers, was
called to preach an anniversary sermon, on a week evening, some
distance from London.&nbsp; Arrived at the house of the brother
minister, for whom he had undertaken the service, before it
commenced, he requested to be shown into the study, in which he
might spend some little time in preparation: the minister went up
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the London Doctor, as he entered, and
gazed around, &ldquo;this is the place where all the mischief is
done; this is your furnace, this is the spot from whence the
glowing thoughts, and sparks emanate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his host, &ldquo;I come up here to
think, and prepare, and be quiet; one cannot study so well in the
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor strode up and down the room, glancing round the
walls, lined with such few books as the modest means of a humble
minister might be supposed to procure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;and these are the
books, the alimentary canals which absorb the pabulum from whence
you reinvigorate the stores of thought, and rekindle refrigerated
feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doctor,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;these are
my books; I have not got many, you see, for I am not a rich
London minister, but only a poor country pastor; you have a large
library, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>The
great man stood still; he threw a half-indignant and
half-benignant glance upon his humble brother, and he said,
&ldquo;<i>I</i> have no library, <i>I</i> do not want books,
<i>I</i> am <i>the</i> Book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christmas Evans, so far as he could command the
means,&mdash;but they were very few,&mdash;was a voracious
reader; and most of the things he read were welded into material
for the imagination; but much more truly might he have said, than
the awful London dignitary and Doctor, &ldquo;I have no books, I
am the book.&rdquo;&nbsp; His modesty would have prevented him
from ever saying the last; but it was nevertheless eminently and
especially true, he <i>was</i> the book.&nbsp; There was a good
deal in him of the self-contained, self-evolving character; and
it is significant of this, that, while probably he knew little,
or nothing, of our great English classical essayists, John Foster
and his Essays were especially beloved by him; far asunder as
were their spheres, and widely different their more obvious and
manifested life, there was much exceedingly alike in the
structure of their mental characters.</p>
<p>We have already alluded to the dream-life of Christmas Evans;
we should say, that if dreams come from the multitude of
business, the daily occupation, the ordinary life he lived was
well calculated to foster in him the life of dreams.&nbsp; Here
is one,&mdash;a strange piece, which shows the mind in which he
lived:&mdash;&ldquo;I found myself at the gate of hell, and,
standing at the threshold, I saw an opening, beneath I which was
a vast sea of fire, in wave-like motion.&nbsp; Looking at it, I
said, &lsquo;What infinite virtue there must have been in the
blood of Christ to have quenched, for His people, these awful
flames!&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Overcome with the feeling, I knelt
down by the walls of hell, saying, &lsquo;Thanks be unto Thee, O
great and blessed Saviour, that Thou hast dried up this terrible
sea of fire!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon Christ addressed me:
&lsquo;Come this way, and I will show you how it was
done.&rsquo;&nbsp; Looking back, I beheld that the whole sea had
disappeared.&nbsp; Jesus passed over the place, and said:
&lsquo;Come, follow Me.&rsquo;&nbsp; By this time, I was within
what I thought were the gates of hell, where there were many
cells, out of which it was impossible to escape.&nbsp; I found
myself within one of these, and anxious to make my way out.&nbsp;
Still I felt wonderfully calm, as I had only just been conversing
with Jesus, and because He had gone before me, although I had now
lost sight of Him.&nbsp; I got hold of something, with which I
struck the corner of the place in which I stood, saying,
&lsquo;In the name of Jesus, open!&rsquo; and it instantly gave
way; so I did with all the enclosures, until I made my way out
into the open field.&nbsp; Whom should I see there but brethren,
none of whom, however, I knew, except a good old deacon, and
their work was to attend to a nursery of trees; I joined them,
and laid hold of a tree, saying, &lsquo;In the name of Jesus, be
thou plucked up by the root!&rsquo;&nbsp; And it came up as if it
had been a rush.&nbsp; Hence I went forth, as I fancied, to work
miracles, saying, &lsquo;Now I know how the Apostles wrought
miracles in the name of Christ!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during the earlier period of Christmas Evans&rsquo;s
ministry at Anglesea, that a great irruption took place in the
island, and, indeed, throughout the Principality; and the
Sandemanian controversy shook the Churches, and especially the
Baptist Churches, <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>almost beyond all credibility, and certainly beyond what
would have been a possibility, but for the singular power of the
chief leader, John Richard Jones, of Ramoth.&nbsp; Christmas
Evans himself fell for some time beneath the power of Sandemanian
notions.&nbsp; Our readers, perhaps, know enough of this peculiar
form of faith and practice, to be aware that the worst thing that
can be said of it is, that it is a religious ice-plant, religion
in an ice-house,&mdash;a form chiefly remarkable for its rigid
ritualistic conservation of what are regarded as the primitive
forms of apostolic times, conjoined to a separation from, and a
severe and cynical reprobation of, all other Christian sects.</p>
<p>Christmas Evans says of himself at this period: &ldquo;The
Sandemanian heresy affected me so far as to quench the spirit of
prayer for the conversion of sinners, and it induced in my mind a
greater regard for the smaller things of the kingdom of heaven,
than for the greater.&nbsp; I lost the strength which clothed my
mind with zeal, confidence, and earnestness in the pulpit for the
conversion of souls to Christ.&nbsp; My heart retrograded, in a
manner, and I could not realize the testimony of a good
conscience.&nbsp; Sabbath nights, after having been in the day
exposing and vilifying, with all bitterness, the errors that
prevailed, my conscience felt as if displeased, and reproached me
that I had lost nearness to, and walking with, God.&nbsp; It
would intimate that something exceedingly precious was now
wanting in me; I would reply, that I was acting in obedience to
the Word; but it continued to accuse me of the want of some
precious article.&nbsp; I had been robbed, to a <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>great degree,
of the spirit of prayer, and of the spirit of
preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man who headed and gave effect to this Sandemanian
movement, which was regarded as a mighty reform movement, was
Jones of Ramoth.&nbsp; No doubt a real and genuine character
enough, a magnificent orator, a master of bitter wit, and
vigorous declamation.&nbsp; That is a keen saying with which
Richard Hooker commences his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical Polity:&rdquo;
&ldquo;He that goeth about to persuade a multitude, that they are
not so well governed as they ought to be, shall never want
attentive and favourable hearers; because they know the manifold
defects whereunto every kind of regiment is subject; but the
secret lets and difficulties, which in public proceedings are
innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment
to consider.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seems to have been the work, and
this the effect, of John Richard Jones: very much the sum and
substance of his preaching grew to be a morbid horror of the
entire religious world, and a supreme contempt&mdash;one of his
memorialists says, a superb contempt&mdash;for all preachers
except himself, especially for all itinerant preachers.&nbsp; In
fact, Ramoth Jones&rsquo;s influence in Anglesea might well be
described in George MacDonald&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;The Waesome
Carl:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a&rsquo; wrang, and a&rsquo;
wrang,<br />
And a&rsquo;thegither a&rsquo; wrang;<br />
There&rsquo;s no a man aboot the toon<br />
But&rsquo;s a&rsquo;thegither a&rsquo; wrang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister wasna fit to pray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let alane to preach;<br />
He nowther had the gift o&rsquo; grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yet the gift o&rsquo; speech.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a&rsquo; wrang, and a&rsquo; wrang,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Compared with the slender following of the Sandemanian schism
now,&mdash;for we believe it has but six congregations in the
whole United Kingdom,&mdash;it seems strange to know that it laid
so wonderful a hold upon the island of Anglesea.&nbsp; It did,
however; and that it did was evidently owing to the strong man
whose name we have mentioned.&nbsp; He was a self-formed man, but
he was a man, if not of large scholarship, of full acquaintance
with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; he was a skilful musician; he
understood the English language well, but of the Welsh he was a
great master.&nbsp; But his intelligence, we should think, was
dry and hard; his sentiments were couched in bitter sarcasm:
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;every Bible in the world were
consumed, and every word of Scripture erased from my memory, I
need be at no loss how to live a religious life, according to the
will of God, for I should simply have to proceed in all respects
in a way perfectly contrary to the popular religionists of this
age, and then I could not possibly be wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
very arrogant and authoritative in tone and manner, supercilious
himself, and expecting the subordination of others.&nbsp; He was
so bitter and narrow, that one naturally supposes that some
injustice had embittered him.&nbsp; Some of <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>his words
have a noble ring.&nbsp; But he encouraged a spirit far other
than a charitable one wherever his word extended; and it has been
not unnaturally said, that the spread of this Sandemanian
narrowness in Anglesea, realized something of the old Scotch
absurdity of having two Churches in the same cottage, consisting
of Janet in one apartment, and Sandy in the other; or of that
other famed Scottish Church, which had dwindled down to two
members, old Dame Christie, and Donald, but which seemed at last
likely to dwindle yet farther into one, as Christie said she had
&ldquo;sair doubts o&rsquo; Donald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work of Christmas Evans, so far successful, seemed likely
to be undone; all the Churches seemed inoculated by these new and
narrow notions, and Christmas Evans himself appears, as we have
seen, to have been not altogether unscathed.&nbsp; There is
something so plausible in this purism of pride; and many such a
creed of pessimism is the outgrowth of indifference born, and
nurtured, upon decaying faith,&mdash;a faith which, perhaps, as
in the instance of Ramoth Jones and his Sandemanian teachers,
continued true to Christ, so far as that is compatible with utter
indifference to humanity at large, and an utter separation from
the larger view of the Communion of Saints.</p>
<p>There was, however, a grand man, who stood firm while
ministers and Churches around him were reeling, Thomas Jones, of
Glynceiriog, in Denbighshire; he is said to have been the one and
only minister, at all known to the public, who remained in his
own denomination firm, and, successfully in his own spirit,
withstood, and even conquered, in this <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>storm of new opinion.&nbsp; And this
Thomas Jones did not stand like an insensible stone or rock, but
like a living oak, braving the blasts of veering opinion.&nbsp;
Most men think in crowds,&mdash;which is only to say they are the
victims of thoughtless plausibilities.&nbsp; This Thomas Jones
appears to have known what he believed; he was eminent for his
politeness, and greatly deferential in his bearing; but with all
this, his courtesy was the courtesy of the branch which bows, but
retains its place.&nbsp; He was a man of marvellous memory, and
Christmas Evans used to say of him, that wherever Thomas Jones
was, no Concordance would be necessary.&nbsp; He was a great
master in the study of Edwards &ldquo;On the Freedom of the
Will,&rdquo; and his method of reading the book was
characteristic; he would first seize a proposition, then close
the book, and close his eyes, and turn the proposition round and
round that it might be undisturbed by anything inside the
treatise, or outside of it, and in this way he would proceed with
the rigorous demonstration.&nbsp; He was a calm and dignified
knight in the tournament of discussion; and, before his lance,
more vehement but less trained thinkers and theologians went
down.</p>
<p>Thus it was that he preached a great Association sermon at
Llangevni, in 1802, which dealt the Sandemanian schism a fatal
blow; the captivity beneath the spell of the influence of Ramoth
Jones was broken, and turned as streams in the south.&nbsp; While
the sermon was being preached, Christmas Evans said, &ldquo;This
Thomas Jones is a monster of a man!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the great
revival sprang up,&mdash;the ice reign was over; but shortly
after, he was called away <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>to Rhydwilym, in
Caermarthenshire.&nbsp; Young as he was, when John Elias heard of
his departure, he said, &ldquo;The light of the north is
removed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died full of years, full of honours,
full of love; closing a life, says one, of quiet beauty, which
perhaps has never been surpassed, at Rhydwilym, in 1850.</p>
<p>This irruption of Sandemanian thought, as we have said and
seen, affected the spiritual life and earnest usefulness of
Christmas Evans.&nbsp; It is well we should place this passing
flower upon the memory of Jones of Rhydwilym, for he, it seems,
broke the spell and dissolved the enchantment, and bade, in the
heart of Christmas Evans, the imprisoned waters once more to flow
forth warm, and rejoicing, in the life and enthusiasm of
love.&nbsp; May we not say, in passing, that some such spell, if
not beneath the same denomination of opinion, holds many hearts
in bondage among the Churches in our time?</p>
<p>The joy which Christmas Evans felt in his deliverance,
realizes something of the warm words of the poet of the
<i>Messiah</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The swain in barren deserts, with
surprise<br />
Sees lilies spring, and sudden verdure rise;<br />
And starts, amidst the thirsty wilds, to hear<br />
New falls of water murmuring in his ear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was weary,&rdquo; he says, referring to this period,
&ldquo;of a cold heart towards Christ, and His sacrifice, and the
work of His Spirit&mdash;of a cold heart in the pulpit, in secret
prayer, and in the study.&nbsp; For fifteen years previously, I
had felt my heart burning within, as if going to Emmaus with
Jesus.&nbsp; On a day ever to be remembered by me, as I was going
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>from
Dolgelly to Machynlleth, and climbing up towards Cadair Idris, I
considered it to be incumbent upon me to pray, however hard I
felt in my heart, and however worldly the frame of my spirit
was.&nbsp; Having begun in the name of Jesus, I soon felt, as it
were, the fetters loosening, and the old hardness of heart
softening, and, as I thought, mountains of frost and snow
dissolving and melting within me.&nbsp; This engendered
confidence in my soul in the promise of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; I
felt my whole mind relieved from some great bondage; tears flowed
copiously, and I was constrained to cry out for the gracious
visits of God, by restoring to my soul the joys of His salvation;
and that He would visit the Churches in Anglesea that were under
my care.&nbsp; I embraced in my supplications all the Churches of
the saints, and nearly all the ministers in the Principality by
their names.&nbsp; This struggle lasted for three hours; it rose
again and again, like one wave after another, or a high flowing
tide, driven by a strong wind, until my nature became faint by
weeping and crying.&nbsp; Thus I resigned myself to Christ, body
and soul, gifts and labours&mdash;all my life&mdash;every day,
and every hour that remained for me; and all my cares I committed
to Christ.&nbsp; The road was mountainous and lonely, and I was
wholly alone, and suffered no interruption in my wrestlings with
God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this time, I was made to expect the goodness of
God to Churches, and to myself.&nbsp; Thus the Lord delivered me
and the people of Anglesea from being carried away by the flood
of Sandemanianism.&nbsp; In the first religious meetings after <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>this, I felt
as if I had been removed from the cold and sterile regions of
spiritual frost, into the verdant fields of Divine
promises.&nbsp; The former striving with God in prayer, and the
longing anxiety for the conversion of sinners, which I had
experienced at L&euml;yn, were now restored.&nbsp; I had a hold
of the promises of God.&nbsp; The result was, when I returned
home, the first thing that arrested my attention was, that the
Spirit was working also in the brethren in Anglesea, inducing in
them a spirit of prayer, especially in two of the deacons, who
were particularly importunate that God would visit us in mercy,
and render the Word of His grace effectual amongst us for the
conversion of sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to about this time belongs a most interesting article,
preserved among his papers, &ldquo;a solemn covenant with
God,&rdquo; made, he says, &ldquo;under a deep sense of the evil
of his own heart, and in dependence upon the infinite grace and
merit of the Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a fine illustration of
the spirit and faith of the man in his lonely communions among
the mountains.</p>
<h3>Covenant with God.</h3>
<blockquote><p>I.&nbsp; I give my soul and body unto Thee, Jesus,
the true God, and everlasting life; deliver me from sin, and from
eternal death, and bring me into life everlasting.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I call the day, the sun, the earth, the trees, the
stones, the bed, the table, and the books, to witness that I come
unto Thee, Redeemer of sinners, that I may obtain rest for my
soul from the thunders of guilt and the dread of eternity.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; I do, through confidence in Thy power, earnestly
entreat Thee to take the work into Thine own hand, and <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>give me a
circumcised heart, that I may love Thee; and create in me a right
spirit, that I may seek thy glory.&nbsp; Grant me that principle
which Thou wilt own in the day of judgment, that I may not then
assume pale-facedness, and find myself a hypocrite.&nbsp; Grant
me this, for the sake of Thy most precious blood.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; I entreat Thee, Jesus, the Son of God, in power
grant me, for the sake of Thy agonizing death, a covenant
interest in Thy blood which cleanseth; in Thy righteousness,
which justifieth; and in Thy redemption, which delivereth.&nbsp;
I entreat an interest in Thy blood, for Thy <i>blood&rsquo;s</i>
sake, and a part in Thee, for Thy Name&rsquo;s sake, which Thou
hast given among men.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; O Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, take, for the
sake of Thy cruel death, my time, and strength, and the gifts and
talents I possess; which, with a full purpose of heart, I
consecrate to Thy glory in the building up of Thy Church in the
world, for Thou art worthy of the hearts and talents of all
men.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; I desire Thee, my great High Priest, to confirm, by
Thy power from Thy High Court, my usefulness as a preacher, and
my piety as a Christian, as two gardens nigh to each other; that
sin may not have place in my heart to becloud my confidence in
Thy righteousness, and that I may not be left to any foolish act
that may occasion my gifts to wither, and I be rendered useless
before my life ends.&nbsp; Keep Thy gracious eye upon me, and
watch over me, O my Lord, and my God for ever!&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; I give myself in a particular manner to Thee, O
Jesus Christ the Saviour, to be preserved from the falls into
which many stumble, that Thy name (in Thy cause) may not be
blasphemed or wounded, that my peace may not be injured, that Thy
people may not be grieved, and that Thine enemies may not be
hardened.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; I come unto Thee, beseeching Thee to be in <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>covenant with
me in my ministry.&nbsp; As Thou didst prosper Bunyan, Vavasor
Powell, Howell Harris, Rowlands, and Whitfield, O do Thou prosper
me.&nbsp; Whatsoever things are opposed to my prosperity, remove
them out of the way.&nbsp; Work in me everything approved of God
for the attainment of this.&nbsp; Give me a heart &ldquo;sick of
love&rdquo; to Thyself, and to the souls of men.&nbsp; Grant that
I may experience the power of Thy Word before I deliver it, as
Moses felt the power of his own rod, before he saw it on the land
and waters of Egypt.&nbsp; Grant this, for the sake of Thine
infinitely precious blood, O Jesus, my hope, and my all in
all.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; Search me now, and lead me into plain paths of
judgment.&nbsp; Let me discover in this life what I am before
Thee, that I may not find myself of another character when I am
shown in the light of the immortal world, and open my eyes in all
the brightness of eternity.&nbsp; Wash me in Thy redeeming
blood.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; Grant me strength to depend upon Thee for food and
raiment, and to make known my requests.&nbsp; O let Thy care be
over me as a covenant-privilege betwixt Thee and myself, and not
like a general care to feed the ravens that perish, and clothe
the lily that is cast into the oven; but let Thy care be over me
as one of Thy family, as one of Thine unworthy brethren.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; Grant, O Jesus, and take upon Thyself the preparing
of me for death, for Thou art God; there is no need but for Thee
to speak the word.&nbsp; If possible, Thy will be done; leave me
not long in affliction, nor to die suddenly, without bidding
adieu to my brethren, and let me die in their sight, after a
short illness.&nbsp; Let all things be ordered against the day of
removing from one world to another, that there be no confusion
nor disorder, but a quiet discharge in peace.&nbsp; O grant me
this, for the sake of Thine agony in the garden.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>XII.&nbsp; Grant, O blessed Lord, that nothing may grow
and be matured in me to occasion Thee to cast me off from the
service of the sanctuary, like the sons of Eli; and for the sake
of Thine unbounded merit, let not my days be longer than my
usefulness.&nbsp; O let me not be like lumber in a house in the
end of my days, in the way of others to work.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; I beseech Thee, O Redeemer, to present these my
supplications before the Father; and oh, inscribe them in Thy
Book with Thine own immortal pen, while I am writing them with my
mortal hand in my book on earth.&nbsp; According to the depths of
Thy merit, Thine undiminished grace, and Thy compassion, and Thy
manner unto Thy people, O attach Thy Name in Thine Upper Court to
these unworthy petitions; and set Thine Amen to them, as I do on
my part of the covenant.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;<span

</blockquote>
<p>Is not this an amazing document?&nbsp; It is of this time that
he further writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I felt a sweet peace and
tranquillity of soul, like unto a poor man that had been brought
under the protection of the Royal Family, and had an annual
settlement for life made upon him; and from whose dwelling
painful dread of poverty and want had been for ever banished
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard of God-intoxicated men; and what
language can more appropriately describe a covenant-engagement so
elevated, so astonishing, and sublime?</p>
<p>Now, apparently strengthened as by a new spirit, with
&ldquo;might in the inner man,&rdquo; he laboured with renewed
energy and zeal; and new and singular blessings descended upon
his labours.&nbsp; In two years, his ten preaching places in
Anglesea were increased <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>to twenty, and six hundred converts
were added to the Church under his own immediate care.&nbsp; It
seemed as if the wilderness and the solitary place were glad for
him, and the desert rejoiced and blossomed as the rose.</p>
<p>Probably, Christmas Evans&rsquo;s name had been scarcely
announced, or read, in England, until his great Graveyard Sermon
was introduced to a company of friends, by the then celebrated
preacher, Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool.&nbsp; As the story has been
related, some persons present had affected contempt for Welsh
preaching.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Raffles,
&ldquo;and I will give to you a specimen of Welsh
eloquence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon those present, the effect was, we
suppose, electrical.&nbsp; He was requested to put it in print;
and so the sermon became very extensively known, and has been
regarded, by many, as the preacher&rsquo;s most astonishing
piece.</p>
<p>To what exact period of Evans&rsquo;s history it is to be
assigned cannot be very well ascertained, but it is probably
nearly sixty years since Raffles first recited it; so that it
belongs, beyond a doubt, to the early Anglesea days.&nbsp; It
was, most likely, prepared as a great bardic or dramatic chant
for some vast Association meeting, and was, no doubt, repeated
several times, for it became very famous.&nbsp; It mingles
something of the life of an old Mystery Play, or Ober-Ammergau
performance; but as to any adequate rendering of it, we apprehend
that to be quite impossible.&nbsp; Raffles was a rhetorician, and
famous as his version became, the good Doctor knew little or
nothing of Welsh, nor was the order of his mind likely very
accurately to render either the Welsh <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>picture or the Welsh accent.&nbsp;
His periods were too rounded, the language too fine, and the
pictures too highly coloured.</p>
<p>It was about the same time that, far away from Anglesea, among
the remote, unheard-of German mountains of Baireuth, a dreamer of
a very different kind was visited by some such vision of the
world, regarded as a great churchyard.&nbsp; Jean Paul
Richter&rsquo;s churchyard, visited by the dead Christ, was
written in Siebinckas, for the purpose of presenting the misty,
starless, cheerless, and spectral outlook of the French atheism,
which was then spreading out, noxious and baleful, over
Europe.</p>
<p>Very different were the two men, their spheres, and their
avocations; overwhelming, solemn, and impressive as is the vision
of Jean Paul, it certainly would have said little to a vast Welsh
congregation among the dark hills.&nbsp; Christmas Evans&rsquo;s
piece is dramatic; his power of impersonation and colloquy in the
pulpit was very great; and the reader has to conceive all this,
while on these colder pages the scenes and the conversations go
on.&nbsp; It appears to have been first preached in a small dell
among the mountains of Carnarvonshire.&nbsp; The spot was
exquisitely romantic; it was a summer&rsquo;s season, the grass
was in its rich green, brooks were purling round, and the spot
hemmed in by jagged crags and the cliffs of tall mountains; a
beautiful spot, but an Englishman spoke of it as &ldquo;beauty
sleeping on the lap of terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A preliminary service, of course, went on,&mdash;hymns, the
sounding of the slow, plaintive minor melody from thousands of
tongues, rising and loitering, and <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>lingering among the neighbouring
acclivities, before they finally fade off into silence; then
there is reading, and prayer, singing again, and a short sermon
before Christmas Evans comes.&nbsp; He has not attained to the
full height of his great national fame as yet; he is before the
people, however, &ldquo;the one-eyed man of
Anglesea,&rdquo;&mdash;the designation by which he was to be
known for many years to come.&nbsp; He stands six feet high, his
face very expressive, but very calm and quiet; but a great fire
was burning within the man.&nbsp; He gave out some verses of a
well-known Welsh hymn, and while it was being sung took out a
small phial from his waistcoat-pocket, wetting the tips of his
fingers and drawing them over his blind eye; it was laudanum,
used to deaden the excruciating pain which upon some occasions
possessed him.</p>
<p>He gave out his text from Romans v. 15: &ldquo;If through the
offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the
gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
unto many.&rdquo;&nbsp; Naturally, he does not begin at once, but
spends a little time, in clearly-enunciated words, in announcing
two things,&mdash;the universal depravity and sinfulness of men,
and the sighing after propitiation.&nbsp; <i>Mene</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Tekel</i>! he says, is written on every human heart; wanting,
wanting, is inscribed on heathen fanes and altars, on the laws,
customs, and institutions of every nation, and on the universal
consciousness of mankind; and bloody sacrifices among pagan
nations show the handwriting of remorse upon the
conscience,&mdash;a sense of guilt, and a dread of punishment,
and a fear which hath torment.</p>
<p>As he goes on the people draw nearer, become <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>more intense
in their earnest listening; they are rising from their seats,
their temporary forms.&nbsp; Some are in carriages; there is a
lady leaning on her husband&rsquo;s shoulder, he still sitting,
she with outstretched neck gazing with obviously strange emotion
at the preacher; some of the people are beginning to weep.&nbsp;
There is an old evangelical clergyman who has always preached the
Gospel, although laughed at by his squire, and quite unknown by
his Bishop; he is rejoicing with a great joy to hear his old
loved truths set forth in such a manner; he is weeping
profusely.</p>
<p>Christmas Evans, meantime, is pursuing his way, lost in his
theme.&nbsp; Now his eye lights up, says one who knew him, like a
brilliantly-flashing star, his clear forehead expands, his form
dilates in majestic dignity; and all that has gone before will be
lost in the white-heat passion with which he prepares to sing of
Paradise lost, and Paradise regained.&nbsp; One of his Welsh
critics says: &ldquo;All the stores of his energy, and the
resources of his voice, which was one of great compass, depth,
and sweetness, seemed reserved for the closing portions of the
picture, when he represented the routed and battered hosts of
evil retreating from the cross, where they anticipated a triumph,
and met a signal, and irretrievable overthrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
prepared, he presented to his hearers the picture of</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The World as a
Graveyard</span>.&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; exclaimed the impassioned
preacher, &ldquo;I find myself standing upon the summit of one of
the highest of the everlasting hills, permitted from thence to
take a <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>survey of the whole earth; and all before me I see a
wide and far-spread burial-ground, a graveyard, over which lie
scattered the countless multitudes of the wretched and perishing
children of Adam!&nbsp; The ground is full of hollows, the
yawning caverns of death; and over the whole scene broods a thick
cloud of darkness: no light from above shines upon it, there is
no ray of sun or moon, there is no beam, even of a little candle,
seen through all its borders.&nbsp; It is walled all around, but
it has gates, large and massive, ten thousand times stronger than
all the gates of brass forged among men; they are one and all
safely locked,&mdash;the hand of Divine Law has locked them; and
so firmly secured are the strong bolts, that all the created
powers even of the heavenly world, were they to labour to all
eternity, could not drive so much as one of them back.&nbsp; How
hopeless is the wretchedness to which the race is doomed! into
what irrecoverable depths of ruin has sin plunged the people who
sit there in darkness, and in the shadow of death, while there,
by the brazen gates, stands the inflexible guard, brandishing the
flaming sword of undeviating Law!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&nbsp; In the cool of the day, there is one
descending from the eternal hills in the distance: it is Mercy!
the radiant form of Mercy, seated in the chariot of Divine
Promise.&nbsp; She comes through the worlds of the universe; she
pauses here to mark the imprisoned and grave-like aspect of our
once fair world; her eye affected her heart as she beheld the
misery, and heard the cry of despair, borne upon the four winds
of heaven; she could not pass by, nor pass on; she wept over the
melancholy scene, and she said, &lsquo;Oh that I might
enter!&nbsp; I would bind up their wounds, I would relieve their
sorrows, I would save their souls!&rsquo;&nbsp; An embassy of
angels, commissioned from Heaven to some other world, paused at
the sight; and Heaven forgave that pause.&nbsp; They saw Mercy
standing by the gate, and they cried, &lsquo;Mercy, canst thou
not enter?&nbsp; Canst thou look upon that world and not
pity?&nbsp; Canst thou pity and not <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>relieve?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Mercy, in
tears, replied, &lsquo;I can see, and I can pity, but I cannot
relieve.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why dost thou not enter?&rsquo;
inquired the heavenly host.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mercy,
&lsquo;Law has barred the gate against me, and I must not, and I
cannot unbar it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Law stood there watching the
gate, and the angels asked of him, &lsquo;Why wilt thou not
suffer Mercy to enter?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he said, &lsquo;No one
can enter here and live;&rsquo; and the thunder of his voice
outspoke the wailings within.&nbsp; Then again I heard Mercy cry,
&lsquo;Is there no entrance for me into this field of death? may
I not visit these caverns of the grave; and seek, if it may be,
to raise some at least of these children of destruction, and
bring them to the light of day?&nbsp; Open, Justice, Open! drive
back these iron bolts, and let me in, that I may proclaim the
jubilee of redemption to the children of the dust!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then I heard Justice reply, &lsquo;Mercy! surely thou lovest
Justice too well to wish to burst these gates by force of arm,
and thus to obtain entrance by lawless violence.&nbsp; I cannot
open the door: I am not angry with these unhappy, I have no
delight in their death, or in hearing their cries, as they lie
upon the burning hearth of the great fire, kindled by the wrath
of God, in the land that is lower than the grave.&nbsp; But
<i>without shedding of blood there is no
remission</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mercy expanded her wings, splendid beyond the
brightness of the morning when its rays are seen shooting over
mountains of pearl,&mdash;and Mercy renewed her flight amongst
the unfallen worlds; she re-ascended into the mid air, but could
not proceed far, because she could not forget the sad sight of
the Graveyard-World, the melancholy prison.&nbsp; She returned to
her native throne in the Heaven of heavens; it was a glorious
high throne, unshaken and untarnished by the fallen fate of man
and angels.&nbsp; Even there she could not forget what she had
witnessed, and wept over, and she weighed the woes of the sad
world against the doom of eternal Law; she could not forget the
prison and the graveyard, and she re-descended with a more rapid
and radiant <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>flight, and she stood again by the gate, but again was
denied admission.&nbsp; And the two stood there together, Justice
and Mercy; and Justice dropped his brandishing sword while they
held converse together; and while they talked, there was silence
in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is there then no admission on any terms
whatever?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; said
Justice; &lsquo;but then they are terms which no created being
can fulfil.&nbsp; I demand atoning death for the Eternal life of
those who lie in this Graveyard; I demand Divine life for their
ransom.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while they were talking, behold there
stood by them a third Form, fairer than the children of men,
radiant with the glory of heaven.&nbsp; He cast a look upon the
graveyard.&nbsp; And He said to Mercy, &lsquo;Accept the
terms.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the security?&rsquo; said
Justice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Mercy, pointing to the
radiant Stranger, &lsquo;is my bond.&nbsp; Four thousand years
from hence, demand its payment on Calvary.&nbsp; To redeem
men,&rsquo; said Mercy, &lsquo;I will be incarnate in the Son of
God, I will be the Lamb slain for the life of this Graveyard
World.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bond was accepted, and Mercy entered the graveyard
leaning on the arm of Justice.&nbsp; She spoke to the
prisoners.&nbsp; Centuries rolled by.&nbsp; So went on the
gathering of the firstfruits in the field of redemption.&nbsp;
Still ages passed away, and at last the clock of prophecy struck
the fulness of time.&nbsp; The bond, which had been committed to
patriarchs and prophets, had to be redeemed; a long series of
rites and ceremonies, sacrifices and oblations, had been
instituted to perpetuate the memory of that solemn deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the close of the four thousandth year, when
Daniel&rsquo;s seventy weeks were accomplished, Justice and Mercy
appeared on the hill of Calvary; angels and archangels, cherubim
and seraphim, principalities and powers, left their thrones and
mansions of glory, and bent over the battlements of heaven,
gazing in mute amazement and breathless suspense upon the solemn
scene.&nbsp; At the foot of Calvary&rsquo;s hill was beheld the
Son of God.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lo, I come,&rsquo; He said; <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>&lsquo;in the
bond it is written of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He appeared without the
gates of Jerusalem, crowned with thorns, and followed by the
weeping Church.&nbsp; It was with Him the hour and the power of
darkness; above Him were all the vials of Divine wrath, and the
thunders of the eternal Law; round Him were all the powers of
darkness,&mdash;the monsters of the pit, huge, fierce and
relentless, were there; the lions as a great army, gnashing their
teeth ready to tear him in pieces; the unicorns, a countless
host, were rushing onwards to thrust him through; and there were
the bulls of Bashan roaring terribly; the dragons of the pit
unfolding themselves, and shooting out their stings; and dogs,
many, all round the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He passed through this dense array, an unresisting
victim led as a lamb to the slaughter.&nbsp; He took the bond
from the hand of Justice, and, as He was nailed to the cross, He
nailed it to the cross; and all the hosts of hell, though
invisible to man, had formed a ring around it.&nbsp; The rocks
rent, the sun shrank from the scene, as Justice lifted his right
hand to the throne, exclaiming, &lsquo;Fires of heaven, descend
and consume this sacrifice!&rsquo;&nbsp; The fires of heaven,
animated with living spirit, answered the call, &lsquo;We come!
we come! and, when we have consumed that victim, we will burn the
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; They burst, blazed, devoured; the blood of
the victim was fast dropping; the hosts of hell were shouting,
until the humanity of Emmanuel gave up the ghost.&nbsp; The fire
went on burning until the ninth hour of the day, but when it
touched the Deity of the Son of God it expired; Justice dropped
the fiery sword at the foot of the cross; and the Law joined with
the prophets in witnessing to the righteousness which is by faith
in the Son of God, for all had heard the dying Redeemer exclaim,
&lsquo;It is finished!&rsquo;&nbsp; The weeping Church heard it,
and lifting up her head cried too, &lsquo;It is
finished!&rsquo;&nbsp; Attending angels hovering near heard it,
and, winging their flight, they sang, &lsquo;It is
finished!&rsquo;&nbsp; The powers of darkness heard the
acclamations of the universe, and hurried away from the scene in
death-like <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>feebleness.&nbsp; He triumphed over them openly.&nbsp;
The graves of the old Burial-ground have been thrown open, and
gales of life have blown over the valley of dry bones, and an
exceeding great army has already been sealed to our God as among
the living in Zion; for so the Bond was paid and eternal
redemption secured.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was certainly singular preaching; it reads like a leaf or
two from Klopstock.&nbsp; We may believe that the enjoyment with
which it was heard was rich and great, but we suppose that the
taste of our time would regard it as almost intolerable.&nbsp;
Still, there are left among us some who can enjoy the
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, and the <i>Fairy Queen</i>, and
we do not see how, in the presence of those pieces, a very
arrogant exception can be taken to this extraordinary sermon.</p>
<p>A more serious objection, perhaps, will be taken to the
nomenclature, the symbolic language in which the preacher
expressed his theology.&nbsp; It literally represented the
theology of Wales at the time when it was delivered; the theology
was stern and awful; the features of God were those of a stern
and inflexible Judge; nature presented few relieving lights, and
man was not regarded as pleasant to look upon.&nbsp; Let the
reader remember all this, and perhaps he will be more tolerant to
the stern outline of this allegory; it is pleasant, now, to know
that we have changed all that, and that everywhere, and all
around us, God, and nature, and man are presented in rose-hued
lights, and all conditions of being are washed by rosy and
pacific seas; we see nothing stern or awful now, either in nature
or in grace, in natural or <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>in supernatural things; Justice has
become gentlemanly, and Law, instead of being stern and terrible,
is bland, and graceful, and beautiful as a woman&rsquo;s
smile!</p>
<p>In Christmas Evans&rsquo;s day, it was not quite so.&nbsp; As
to objections to the mode of preaching, as in contrast with that
style which adopts only the sustained argument, and the
rhetorical climax and relation, we have already said that
Christmas must be tried by quite another standard; we have
already said that he was a bard among preachers, and belonged to
a nation of bards.&nbsp; It was a kind of primeval song,
addressed to people of primeval instincts; but, whatever its
merits or demerits may be, it fairly represents the man and his
preaching.&nbsp; It does not, indeed, reflect the style of the
modern mind; but, there are many writers, and readers at present,
who are carrying us back to the medi&aelig;val times, and the
monastic preachers of those ages, and among them we find
innumerable pieces of the same order of sustained allegory which
we have just quoted from Christmas Evans.&nbsp; What is it but to
say, that the simple mind is charmed with pictures,&mdash;it must
have them; and such sermons as abound in them, have power over
it?</p>
<p>We believe we have rendered this singular passage with such
fairness that the reader may be enabled to form some idea of its
splendour.&nbsp; When it was repeated to Robert Hall, he
pronounced it one of the finest allegories in the language.&nbsp;
When Christmas Evans was on a visit to Dr. Raffles, the Doctor
recited to him his own version, and, apparently with some
amazement, said, &ldquo;Did you actually say all <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said
Christmas, &ldquo;I did say all that, but I could never have put
it into such English.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this we are greatly
disposed to regard as impairing the bold grandeur and strength of
the piece; any rendering of it into English must, as it seems to
us, add to its prettiness, and therefore divest it of its
power.</p>
<p>Probably to the same period of the preacher&rsquo;s history
belongs another sermon, which has always seemed to us a piece of
undoubted greatness.&nbsp; It is upon the same subject, the
Crucifixion of Christ.&nbsp; We should think that its delivery
would, at any time, from such lips as his, produce equally
pathetic emotions.&nbsp; The allegory is not so sustained, but it
is still full of allegorical allusions derived from Scriptural
expression.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Hind of the
Morning</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is generally admitted that the
twenty-second Psalm has particular reference to Christ.&nbsp;
This is evident from His own appropriation of the first verse
upon the cross: &lsquo;My God! my God! why hast Thou forsaken
Me?&rsquo;&nbsp; The title of that Psalm is &lsquo;<i>Aijeleth
Shahar</i>,&rsquo; which signifies &lsquo;A Hart, or the Hind of
the Morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; The striking metaphors which it
contains are descriptive of Messiah&rsquo;s peculiar
sufferings.&nbsp; He is the Hart, or the Hind of the Morning,
hunted by the Black Prince, with his hell-hounds&mdash;by Satan,
and all his allies.&nbsp; The &lsquo;dogs,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;lions,&rsquo; the &lsquo;unicorns,&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;strong bulls of Bashan,&rsquo; with their devouring teeth,
and their terrible horns, pursued Him from Bethlehem to
Calvary.&nbsp; They beset Him in the manger, gnashed upon Him in
the garden, and well-nigh tore Him to pieces upon the
cross.&nbsp; And still they persecute Him in His cause, and in
the persons and interests of His people.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&ldquo;The faith of the Church anticipated the coming of
Christ, &lsquo;like a roe or a young hart,&rsquo; with the dawn
of the day promised in Eden; and we hear her exclaiming in the
Canticles&mdash;&lsquo;The voice of my beloved! behold, He
cometh, leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
hills!&rsquo;&nbsp; She heard Him announce His advent in the
promise, &lsquo;Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God!&rsquo; and with
prophetic eye, saw Him leaping from the mountains of eternity to
the mountains of time, and skipping from hill to hill throughout
the land of Palestine, going about doing good.&nbsp; In the
various types and shadows of the law, she beheld Him
&lsquo;standing by the wall, looking forth at the windows,
showing Himself through the lattice;&rsquo; and then she
sang&mdash;&lsquo;Until the day break and the shadows flee away,
turn, my beloved, and be thou like the roe or the young hart upon
the mountains of Bether!&rsquo;&nbsp; Bloody sacrifices revealed
Him to her view, going down to the &lsquo;vineyards of red
wine;&rsquo; whence she traced Him to the meadows of Gospel
ordinances, where &lsquo;He feedeth among the
lilies&rsquo;&mdash;to &lsquo;the gardens of cucumbers,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;the beds of spices;&rsquo; and then she sang to Him
again&mdash;&lsquo;Make haste&rsquo;&mdash;or, flee
away&mdash;&lsquo;my beloved! be thou like the roe or the young
hart among the mountains of spices.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus she longed to see Him, first &lsquo;on the
mountain of Bether,&rsquo; and then &lsquo;on the mountain of
spices.&rsquo;&nbsp; On both mountains she saw Him eighteen
hundred years ago, and on both she may still trace the footsteps
of His majesty, and His mercy.&nbsp; The former, He hath tracked
with His own blood, and His path upon the latter is redolent of
frankincense and myrrh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bether signifies division.&nbsp; This is the craggy
mountain of Calvary; whither the &lsquo;Hind of the
Morning&rsquo; fled, followed by all the wild beasts of the
forest, and the bloodhounds of hell; summoned to the pursuit, and
urged on, by the prince of perdition; till the victim, in His
agony, sweat great drops of blood&mdash;where He was terribly
crushed <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>between the cliffs, and dreadfully mangled by sharp and
ragged rocks&mdash;where He was seized by Death, the great
Bloodhound of the bottomless pit&mdash;whence He leaped the
precipice, without breaking a bone; and sunk in the dead sea,
sunk to its utmost depth, and saw no corruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the &lsquo;Hind of the Morning&rsquo; on that
dreadful mountain!&nbsp; It is the place of skulls, where Death
holds his carnival in companionship with worms, and hell laughs
in the face of heaven.&nbsp; Dark storms are gathering
there&mdash;convolving clouds, charged with no common
wrath.&nbsp; Terrors set themselves in battle-array before the
Son of God; and tempests burst upon Him which might sweep all
mankind in a moment to eternal ruin.&nbsp; Hark! hear ye not the
subterranean thunder?&nbsp; Feel ye not the tremor of the
mountain?&nbsp; It is the shock of Satan&rsquo;s artillery,
playing upon the Captain of our Salvation.&nbsp; It is the
explosion of the magazine of vengeance.&nbsp; Lo, the earth is
quaking, the rocks are rending, the graves are opening, the dead
are rising, and all nature stands aghast at the conflict of
Divine mercy with the powers of darkness.&nbsp; One dread
convulsion more, one cry of desperate agony, and Jesus
dies&mdash;an arrow has entered into His heart.&nbsp; Now leap
the lions, roaring, upon their prey; and the bulls of Bashan are
bellowing; and the dogs of perdition are barking; and the
unicorns toss their horns on high; and the devil, dancing with
exultant joy, clanks his iron chains, and thrusts up his fettered
hands in defiance towards the face of Jehovah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go a little farther upon the mountain, and you come to
&lsquo;a new tomb hewn out of the rock.&rsquo;&nbsp; There lies a
dead body.&nbsp; It is the body of Jesus.&nbsp; His disciples
have laid it down in sorrow, and returned, weeping, to the
city.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s heart is broken, Peter&rsquo;s zeal is
quenched in tears, and John would fain lie down and die in his
Master&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; The sepulchre is closed up, and
sealed, and a Roman sentry placed at its entrance.&nbsp; On the
morning of the third day, while it is yet dark, two or three
women come to anoint the <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>body.&nbsp; They are debating about
the great stone at the mouth of the cave.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who shall
roll it away?&rsquo; says one of them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pity we did
not bring Peter, or John with us.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, arriving,
they find the stone already rolled away, and one sitting upon it,
whose countenance is like lightning, and whose garments are white
as the light.&nbsp; The steel-clad, iron-hearted soldiers lie
around him, like men slain in battle, having swooned with
terror.&nbsp; He speaks: &lsquo;Why seek ye the living among the
dead?&nbsp; He is not here; He is risen; He is gone forth from
this cave victoriously.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is even so!&nbsp; For there are the shroud, and the
napkin, and the heavenly watchers; and when He awoke, and cast
off His grave-clothes, the earthquake was felt in the city, and
jarred the gates of hell.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Hind of the
Morning&rsquo; is up earlier than any of His pursuers,
&lsquo;leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
hills.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is seen first with Mary at the tomb; then
with the disciples in Jerusalem; then with two of them on the way
to Emmaus; then going before His brethren into Galilee; and,
finally, leaping upon the top of Olivet to the hills of Paradise;
fleeing away to &lsquo;the mountain of spices,&rsquo; where He
shall never more be hunted by the Black Prince and his
hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is perfect master of gravitation, and all the
laws of nature are obedient to His will.&nbsp; Once He walked
upon the water, as if it were marble beneath His feet; and now,
as He stands blessing His people, the glorious Form, so recently
nailed to the cross, and still more recently cold in the grave,
begins to ascend like &lsquo;the living creature&rsquo; in
Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision, &lsquo;lifted up from the earth,&rsquo;
till nearly out of sight; when &lsquo;the chariots of God, even
thousands of angels,&rsquo; receive Him, and haste to the
celestial city, waking the thrones of eternity with this jubilant
chorus&mdash;&lsquo;Lift up your heads, O ye gates! and be ye
lifted up, ye everlasting doors! and the King of glory shall come
in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ might have rode in a chariot of fire all the way
<a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>from
Bethlehem to Calvary; but he preferred riding in a chariot of
mercy, whose lining was crimson, and whose ornament the
malefactor&rsquo;s cross.&nbsp; How rapidly rolled his wheels
over the hills and the plains of Palestine, gathering up
everywhere the children of affliction, and scattering blessings
like the beams of the morning!&nbsp; Now we find Him in Cana of
Galilee, turning water into wine; then treading the waves of the
sea, and hushing the roar of the tempest; then delivering the
demoniac of Gadara from the fury of a legion of fiends; then
healing the nobleman&rsquo;s son at Capernaum; raising the
daughter of Jairus, and the young man of Nain; writing upon the
grave of Bethany, &lsquo;I am the resurrection and the
life;&rsquo; curing the invalid at the pool of Bethesda; feeding
the five thousand in the wilderness; preaching to the woman by
Jacob&rsquo;s well, acquitting the adulteress, and shaming her
accusers; and exercising everywhere, in all his travels, the
three offices of Physician, Prophet, and Saviour, as he drove on
towards the place of skulls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we see the chariot surrounded with
enemies&mdash;Herod, and Pilate, and Caiaphas, and the Roman
soldiers, and the populace of Jerusalem, and thousands of Jews
who have come up to keep the Passover, led on by Judas and the
devil.&nbsp; See how they rage and curse, as if they would tear
him from his chariot of mercy!&nbsp; But Jesus maintains his
seat, and holds fast the reins, and drives right on through the
angry crowd, without shooting an arrow, or lifting a spear upon
his foes.&nbsp; For in that chariot the King must ride to
Calvary&mdash;Calvary must be consecrated to mercy for
ever.&nbsp; He sees the cross planted upon the brow of the hill,
and hastens forward to embrace it.&nbsp; No sacrifice shall be
offered to Justice on this day, but the one sacrifice which
reconciles heaven and earth.&nbsp; None of these children of
Belial shall suffer to-day.&nbsp; The bribed witnesses, and
clamorous murderers, shall be spared&mdash;the smiters, the
scourgers, the spitters, the thorn-plaiters, the nail drivers, <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the
head-shakers&mdash;for Jesus pleads on their behalf:
&lsquo;Father, forgive them! they know not what they do.&nbsp;
They are ignorant of Thy grace and truth.&nbsp; They are not
aware of whom they are crucifying.&nbsp; Oh, spare them!&nbsp;
Let Death know that he shall have enough to do with <i>me</i>
to-day!&nbsp; Let him open all his batteries upon
<i>me</i>!&nbsp; <i>My</i> bosom is bare to the stroke.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> will gather all the lances of hell in <i>my</i>
heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still the chariot rushes on, and &lsquo;fiery
darts&rsquo; are thick and fast, like a shower of meteors, on
Messiah&rsquo;s head, till He is covered with wounds, and the
blood flows down His garments, and leaves a crimson track behind
Him.&nbsp; As He passes, He casts at the dying malefactor a
glance of benignity, and throws him a passport into Paradise,
written with His own blood; stretches forth His sceptre, and
touches the prison-door of death, and many of the prisoners came
forth, and the tyrant shall never regain his dominion over them;
rides triumphant over thrones and principalities, and crushes
beneath his wheels the last enemy himself, and leaves the
memorial of his march engraven on the rocks of Golgotha!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is everywhere in the Scriptures spoken of as a
Blessing; and whether we contemplate His advent, His ministry,
His miracles, His agony, His crucifixion, His interment, His
resurrection, or His ascension, we may truly say, &lsquo;All His
paths drop fatness.&rsquo;&nbsp; All His travels were on the road
of mercy; and trees are growing up in His footsteps, whose fruit
is delicious food, and &lsquo;whose leaves are for the healing of
the nations.&rsquo;&nbsp; He walketh upon the south winds,
causing propitious gales to blow upon the wilderness till songs
of joy awake in the solitary place, and the desert blossoms as
the rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we will consider what the prophets wrote of the
Messiah, in connection with the evangelical history, we shall be
satisfied that none like Him, either before or since, ever
entered our world, or departed from it.&nbsp; Both God and
man&mdash;at once the Father of eternity and the Son of time, He
filled the universe, while He was embodied upon <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>earth, and
ruled the celestial principalities and powers, while He wandered,
a persecuted stranger, in Judea.&nbsp; &lsquo;No man,&rsquo;
saith He, &lsquo;hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came
down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in
heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven was no strange place to Jesus.&nbsp; He talks of
the mansions in His Father&rsquo;s house as familiarly as one of
the royal family would talk of Windsor Castle where he was born;
and saith to His disciples, &lsquo;I go to prepare a place for
you; that where I am there ye may be also.&rsquo;&nbsp; The glory
into which He entered was His own glory&mdash;the glory which He
had with the Father before the world was.&nbsp; He had an
original and supreme right to the celestial mansions; and He
acquired a new and additional claim by His office as
Mediator.&nbsp; Having suffered for our sins, He &lsquo;ought to
enter into His glory.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ought, because He is
&lsquo;God, blessed for ever;&rsquo; He ought, because He is the
representative of His redeemed people.&nbsp; He has taken
possession of the kingdom in our behalf, and left on record for
our encouragement this cheering promise, &lsquo;To him that
overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne; even as I
also have overcome, and am set down with my Father in His
throne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The departure of God from Eden, and the departure of
Christ from the earth, were two of the sublimest events that ever
occurred, and fraught with immense consequences to our
race.&nbsp; When Jehovah went out from Eden, He left a curse upon
the place for man&rsquo;s sake, and drove out man before him into
an accursed earth.&nbsp; But when Jesus descended from Olivet, He
lifted the curse with Him, and left a blessing behind
Him&mdash;sowed the world with the seed of eternal blessings;
&lsquo;and instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and
instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle-tree; and it shall
be to the Lord for a name, and an everlasting sign, that shall
not be cut off.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ascended to intercede for
sinners, and reopen Paradise to His people; <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>and when He
shall come the second time, according to the promise, with all
His holy angels, then shall we be &lsquo;caught up to meet the
Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the
Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord is gone up with a shout!&rsquo; and has
taken our redeemed nature with Him.&nbsp; He is the Head of the
Church, and is the representative at the right hand of the
Father.&nbsp; &lsquo;He hath ascended on high; He hath led
captivity captive; He hath received gifts for men; yea, for the
rebellious also, that God may dwell among them.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Him hath God exalted, with His own right hand, to be a
Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission
of sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is the Father&rsquo;s recognition of
His &lsquo;Beloved Son,&rsquo; and significant acceptance of his
sacrifice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
Him, and given Him a name which is above every name; that at the
name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and
things in the earth, and things under the earth; and that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
God the Father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence of our Lord&rsquo;s ascension is
ample.&nbsp; He ascended in the presence of many witnesses, who
stood gazing after Him till a cloud received Him out of their
sight.&nbsp; And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, two
angels appeared to them, and talked with them of what they had
seen.&nbsp; Soon afterward, on the day of Pentecost, He
fulfilled, in a remarkable manner, the promise which He had made
to His people: &lsquo;If I go away I will send you another
Comforter, who shall abide with you for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Stephen, the first of His disciples that glorified the Master by
martyrdom, testified to his murderers, &lsquo;Lo, I see the
heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of
God!&rsquo;&nbsp; And John, the &lsquo;beloved disciple,&rsquo;
while an exile &lsquo;in Patmos, for the word of God, and the
testimony of Jesus Christ,&rsquo; beheld Him &lsquo;in the midst
of the throne, as a Lamb that had been slain!&rsquo;&nbsp; These
are the evidences <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>that our Lord is in heaven; these are our consolations
in the house of our pilgrimage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Apostle speaks of the <i>necessity</i> of this
event, &lsquo;Whom the heaven <i>must</i> receive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divine necessity is a golden chain reaching from
eternity to eternity, and encircling all the events of
time.&nbsp; It consists of many links all hanging upon each
other; and not one of them can be broken without destroying the
support of the whole.&nbsp; The first link is in God,
&lsquo;before the world was;&rsquo; and the last is in heaven,
when the world shall be no more.&nbsp; Christ is its Alpha, and
Omega, and Christ constitutes all its intervenient links.&nbsp;
Christ in the bosom of the Father, receiving the promise of
eternal life, before the foundation of the world, is the
beginning; Christ in His sacrificial blood, atoning for our sins,
and pardoning and sanctifying all them that believe, is the
middle; and Christ in heaven, pleading the merit of His vicarious
sufferings, making intercession for the transgressors, drawing
all men unto Himself, presenting the prayers of His people, and
preparing their mansions, is the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a necessity in all that Christ has done as our
Mediator, in all that He is doing on our behalf, and all that he
has engaged to do&mdash;the necessity of Divine love manifested,
of Divine mercy exercised, of Divine purposes accomplished, of
Divine covenants fulfilled, of Divine faithfulness maintained, of
Divine justice satisfied, of Divine holiness vindicated, and of
Divine power displayed.&nbsp; Christ felt this necessity while He
tabernacled among us, often declared it to His disciples, and
acknowledged it to the Father in the agony in the Garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold Him wrestling in prayer, with strong crying and
tears: &lsquo;Father, save me from this hour!&nbsp; If it be
possible, let this cup pass from me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the Father
reads to Him His covenant engagement, which He signed and sealed
with His own hand before the foundation of the world.&nbsp; The
glorious Sufferer replies, &lsquo;Thy will be done!&nbsp; For
this <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>cause came I unto this hour.&nbsp; I will drink the cup
which Thou hast mingled, and not a dreg of any of its ingredients
shall be left for my people.&nbsp; I will pass through the
approaching dreadful night, under the hidings of Thy countenance,
bearing away the curse from my beloved.&nbsp; Henceforth
repentance is hidden from my eyes!&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, on His
knees, He reads the covenant engagements of the Father, and adds,
&lsquo;I have glorified Thee on the earth.&nbsp; I have finished
the work which Thou gavest Me to do.&nbsp; Now glorify Thou Me,
according to Thy promise, with Thine own Self, with the glory
which I had with Thee before the world was.&nbsp; Father, I will
also that they whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am,
that they may behold My glory.&nbsp; Thine they were, and Thou
hast given them to Me, on condition of My pouring out My soul
unto death.&nbsp; Thou hast promised them, through My
righteousness and meritorious sacrifice, the kingdom of heaven,
which I now claim on their behalf.&nbsp; Father, glorify My
people, with Him whom Thou lovedst before the foundation of the
world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This intercession of Christ for His saints, begun on
earth, is continued in heaven.&nbsp; This is our confidence and
joy in our journey through the wilderness.&nbsp; We know that our
Joshua has gone over into the land of our inheritance, where He
is preparing the place of our habitation for Israel; for it is
His will that all whom He has redeemed should be with Him for
ever!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is a text which speaks of the period when the
great purposes of our Lord&rsquo;s ascension shall be fully
accomplished: &lsquo;Until the times of the restitution of all
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The period here mentioned is &lsquo;the dispensation of
the fulness of time,&rsquo; when &lsquo;the fulness of the
Gentiles shall come in,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the dispersed of
Judah&rsquo; shall be restored, and Christ shall &lsquo;gather
together in Himself all things in heaven and in earth,&rsquo;
overthrow his enemies, establish his everlasting kingdom, deliver
the groaning creation from its bondage, glorify His people with
Himself, imprison the <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>devil with his angels in the
bottomless pit, and punish with banishment from His presence them
that obey not the Gospel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this glorious consummation, the great travail of
redemption, and all the events of time, are only
preparatory.&nbsp; It was promised in Eden, and the promise was
renewed and enlarged to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&nbsp; It
was described in gorgeous oriental imagery by Isaiah, and
&lsquo;the sweet Psalmist of Israel;&rsquo; and &lsquo;spoken of
by all the Prophets, since the world began.&rsquo;&nbsp; Christ
came into the world to prepare the way for His future
triumph&mdash;to lay on Calvary the &lsquo;chief
corner-stone&rsquo; of a temple, which shall be completed at the
end of time, and endure through all eternity.&nbsp; He began the
great restitution.&nbsp; He redeemed His people with a price, and
gave them a pledge of redemption by power.&nbsp; He made an end
of sin, abolished the Levitical priesthood, and swallowed up all
the types and shadows in Himself.&nbsp; He sent home the beasts,
overthrew the altars, and quenched the holy fire; and, upon the
sanctifying altar of His own divinity, offered His own sinless
humanity, which was consumed by fire from heaven.&nbsp; He
removed the seat of government from Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, to
Mount Zion above, where He sits&mdash;&lsquo;a Priest upon His
throne,&rsquo; drawing heaven and earth together, and
establishing &lsquo;the covenant of peace between them
both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be God! we can now go to Jesus, the Mediator;
passing by millions of angels, and all &lsquo;the spirits of just
men made perfect;&rsquo; till we &lsquo;come to the blood of
sprinkling, which speaketh better things than that of
Abel.&rsquo;&nbsp; And we look for that blessed day, when
&lsquo;this gospel of the kingdom&rsquo; shall be universally
prevalent; &lsquo;and all shall know the Lord, from the least
even to the greatest;&rsquo; when there shall be a &lsquo;new
heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness;&rsquo;
when both the political, and the moral aspects of our world shall
be changed; and a happier state of things shall exist than has
ever been known before,&mdash;when <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the pestilence, the famine, and the
sword shall cease to destroy, and &lsquo;the saints of the Most
High shall possess the kingdom&rsquo; in &lsquo;quietness, and
assurance for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then cometh the end, when
Emmanuel &lsquo;shall destroy in this mountain the veil of the
covering cast over all people, and swallow up death in
victory!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such sermons as we have quoted surely convey a living and
distinct idea of the kind of power which made the man
remarkable.&nbsp; It is, from every aspect, very unlike the
preaching to which we are now accustomed, and which, therefore,
finds general favour with us; it is dogmatic in the last degree;
nothing in it is tentative, or hypothetical, yet the dogmatism is
not that of a schoolman, or a casuist; it is the dogmatism of
burning conviction, of a profound and unquestioning faith in the
veracity of New Testament truth, and the corresponding light and
illustration from the Old.&nbsp; In these sermons, and others we
shall place before our readers, there is nothing pretty, no nice
metaphysical or critical analysis, no attempt to carve
giants&rsquo; heads on cherry-stones.&nbsp; He realized his
office as a preacher, not as one set apart to minister to
intellectual luxury, or vanity, but to stand, announcing eternal
truth.&nbsp; The people to whom he spoke were not
<i>dilettantic</i>, he was no <i>dilettante</i>.&nbsp; We can
quite conceive,&mdash;and therefore these remarks,&mdash;that the
greater number even of the more eminent men in our modern pulpit
will regard the style of Christmas Evans with contempt.&nbsp; We
are only setting it forth in these pages.&nbsp; Evidently it told
marvellously on the Principality; it &ldquo;searched Jerusalem
with candles;&rdquo; those who despise it had better settle the
question with Christmas Evans himself, and show <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the
superiority of their method by their larger ministerial
usefulness.</p>
<p>The worth and value of great preaching and great sermons must
depend upon the measure to which they represent the
preacher&rsquo;s own familiarity with the truths he touches, and
proclaims.&nbsp; The history of the mind of Christmas Evans is,
from this point of view, very interesting.&nbsp; We can only get
at it from the papers found after his death; but they reveal the
story of the life, walk, and triumph of faith in his mind and
heart.&nbsp; He kept no journal; but still we have the record of
his communions with God amongst the mountains,&mdash;acts of
consecration to God quite remarkable, which he had thought it
well to commit to paper, that he might remind himself of the
engagements he had made.&nbsp; It was after some such season that
he said to a brother minister, &ldquo;Brother, the doctrine, the
confidence, and strength I feel will make people dance with joy
in some parts of Wales;&rdquo; and then, as the tears came into
his eyes whilst he was speaking, he said again, &ldquo;Yes,
brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little idea can be formed of the Welsh preacher from the life
of the minister in England.&nbsp; The congregations, we have
seen, lay wide, and scattered far apart.&nbsp; Often, in Wales
ourselves, we have met the minister pursuing his way on his
horse, or pony, to his next &ldquo;publication;&rdquo; very
often, his Bible in his hand, reading it as he slowly jogged
along.&nbsp; So Christmas Evans passed his life, constantly,
either on foot or on horseback, urging his way; sometimes through
a country frowning as if smitten by a blow of desolation, and at
others, laughing in loveliness and <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>beauty; sometimes through the hot
summer, when the burning beams poured from the craggy mountains;
sometimes in winter, through the snow and rain and coldest
inclemency, to fulfil his engagements.&nbsp; For the greater part
of his life his income was never more than thirty pounds a year,
and for the first part only about from ten to seventeen.&nbsp; It
looks a wretched sum; but we may remember that Luther&rsquo;s
income was never much more; and, probably, what seems to us a
miserable little income, was very much further removed from want,
and even poverty, than in other, less primitive, circumstances is
often an income of hundreds.&nbsp; Certainly, Christmas Evans was
never in want; always, not only comfortable, but able even to
spare, from his limited means, subscriptions to some of the great
societies of the day.</p>

<p>The few glimpses we are able to obtain of the life and
ministry in Anglesea, assure us of the supreme influence obtained
by Christmas Evans, as was natural, over all the Churches of his
order throughout that region.&nbsp; And in a small way, in a
circle far removed from the noise of ideas, and the crowds and
agitations of the great world, incessant activity was imposed
upon him,&mdash;so many Societies under his care, so many
meeting-houses to be erected, <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and funds to be procured for their
erection, so many cases of Church discipline, so many co-pastors
appointed, and set apart to work with him&mdash;who, however,
were men mostly in business, had their own domestic affairs to
manage, and for all the help they could give, needed helping and
guidance; who had to receive instructions from him as to what
they were to do, and whither they were to go,&mdash;so that, in
fact, he was here, in Anglesea, a pastor of pastors, a bishop, if
ever any pastor deserved that designation; an overseer of many
Churches, and of many ministers.&nbsp; And hence, as a matter of
course, in all ministerial meetings, and other smaller
gatherings, he was usually at once not merely the nominal
president, but the presiding spirit.</p>
<p>Rhys Stephen suggests a good many ludicrous aspects to the
monthly meetings, and other such gatherings; indeed, they were of
a very primitive description, and illustrative of what we should
call a very rude, and unconventional state of society.&nbsp;
Order was maintained, apparently, very much after the patriarchal
or patristic fashion.&nbsp; All the preachers he called by their
Christian names, and he would certainly have wondered what
stranger happened to be in the place had any one addressed him as
Mr. Evans; &ldquo;Christmas Evans,&rdquo; before his face and
behind his back, was the name by which he was known not only
throughout all Anglesea, but, by-and-by, throughout the entire
Principality.</p>
<p>Affectionate familiarity sometimes pays the penalty in
diminished reverence, and in a subtraction from the respect due
to a higher gift or superior position.&nbsp; Christmas appears to
have been equal to this <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>dilemma, and to have sustained with
great natural dignity the post of Moderator, without surrendering
his claim upon the affection of his colleagues.&nbsp; In such a
meeting, some humble brother would rise to speak a second time,
and, perhaps, not very pointedly, to the question; then the
Moderator in the pulpit, gathering up his brows, would suddenly
cut across the speaker with, &ldquo;William, my boy, you have
spoken before: have done with it;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Richard,
<i>bach</i>, you have forgotten the question before the meeting:
hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion, a minister from South Wales, although a
native of Anglesea, happening to be present, and rising evidently
with the intention of speaking, Christmas, who suffered no
intrusion from the south into their northern organizations,
instantly nipped the flowers of oratory by crying out, &ldquo;Sit
down, David, sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such instances as these must seem very strange, even
<i>outr&eacute;</i>, to our temper, taste, and ideas of public
meetings; but they furnish a very distinct idea of time, place,
and circumstances, and give a not altogether unbeautiful picture
of a state of society when, if politeness and culture had not
attained their present eminence, there was a good deal of light
and sweetness, however offensive it might seem to our
intellectual Rimmels and Edisons.</p>
<p>Perhaps in every truly great and apostolic preacher, the
preaching power, although before men the most conspicuous, is
really the smallest part of the preacher&rsquo;s labour, and
presents the fewest claims for homage and honour.&nbsp; We have
very little, and know very little, of the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s
sermons and <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>great orations, mighty as they unquestionably were; he
lives to us most in his letters, in his life, and its many
martyrdoms.&nbsp; Ah, we fancy, if Christmas Evans had but to
preach, to stay at home and minister to his one congregation,
what a serene and quiet life it would have been, and how happy in
the humble obscurity of his Cildwrn cottage!</p>
<p>But all his life in Anglesea seems to have been worried with
chapel-debts.&nbsp; Chapels rose,&mdash;it was necessary that
they should rise; people in scattered villages thronged to hear
the Word; many hundreds appear to have crowded into Church
fellowship, chapels had to be multiplied and enlarged; but, so
far as we are able to read his biography, Christmas appears to
have been the only person on whom was laid the burden of paying
for them.&nbsp; Certainly he had no money: his wealth was in his
eloquence, and his fame; and the island of Anglesea appears to
have been by no means indisposed to lay these under
contribution.&nbsp; A chapel had to be raised, and Christmas
Evans was the name upon which the money was very cheerfully lent
for its erection; but by-and-by the interest pressed, or the debt
had to be paid: what could be done then?&nbsp; He must go forth
into the south, and beg from richer Churches, and from brethren
who, with none of his gifts of genius or of holiness, occupied
the higher places in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Our heart is very much melted while we read of all the toils
he accomplished in this way.&nbsp; Where were his sermons
composed?&nbsp; Not so much in his lowly cottage home as in the
long, lonely, toilsome travels on his horse through wild and
unfrequented <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>regions, where, throughout the long day&rsquo;s
journey, he perhaps, sometimes, never met a traveller on the
solitary road.&nbsp; For many years, it is said, he went twice
from his northern bishopric to the south, once to the great
Association, wherever that might be, and where, of course, he was
expected as the chief and most attractive star, but once also
with some chapel case, a journey which always had to be
undertaken in the winter, and which was always a painful
journey.&nbsp; Let us think of him with affection as we see him
wending on, he and his friendly horse, through wild snows, and
rains, and bleak storms of mountain wind.</p>
<p>Scarcely do we need to say he had a highly nervous
temperament.&nbsp; The dear man had a very capricious appetite,
but who ever thought of that?&nbsp; He was thrown upon himself;
but the testimony is that he was a man utterly regardless of his
own health, ridiculously inattentive to his dress, and to all his
travelling arrangements.&nbsp; These journeys with his chapel
case would usually take some six weeks, or two months.&nbsp; It
was no dainty tour in a railway train, with first-class
travelling expenses paid for the best carriage, or the best
hotel.</p>
<p>A man who was something like Christmas Evans, though still at
an infinite remove from him in the grandeur of his genius, a
great preacher, William Dawson&mdash;Billy Dawson, as he is still
familiarly called&mdash;used to say, that in the course of his
ministry he found himself in places where he was sometimes
treated like a bishop, and sometimes like an apostle; sometimes a
great man would receive, and make a great dinner for him, and
invite celebrities to meet him, and give him the best
entertainment, the best <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>room in a large, well-furnished
house, where a warm fire shed a glow over the apartment, and
where he slept on a bed of down,&mdash;and this was what he
called being entertained like a bishop; but in other places he
would be received in a very humble home, coarse fare on the
table, a mug of ale, a piece of oatmeal cake, perhaps a slice of
meat, a poor, unfurnished chamber, a coarse bed, a cold
room,&mdash;and this was what he called being entertained like an
apostle.</p>
<p>We may be very sure that the apostolic entertainment was that
which usually awaited Christmas Evans at the close of his long
day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; Not to be looked upon with contempt
either,&mdash;hearty and free; and, perhaps, the conversation in
the intervals between the puff of the pipe was what we should
rather relish, than the more timorous and equable flow of speech
in the finer mansion.&nbsp; This is certain, however, that the
entertainment of Christmas Evans, in most of his excursions,
would be of the coarsest kind.</p>
<p>And this was far from the worst of his afflictions; there
were, in that day, persons of an order of character, unknown to
our happier, more Christian, and enlightened times,&mdash;pert
and conceited brethren, unworthy to unloose the latchet of the
great man&rsquo;s shoes, but who fancied themselves far above
him, from their leading a town life, and being pastors over
wealthier Churches.&nbsp; Well, they have gone, and we are not
writing their lives, for they never had a life to write, only
they were often annoying flies which teased the poor traveller on
his way.&nbsp; On most of these he took his revenge, by fastening
upon them some <i>sobriquet</i>, <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>which he fetched out of that
imaginative store-house of his,&mdash;from the closets of
compound epithet; these often stuck like a burr to the coat of
the character, and proved to be perhaps the best passport to its
owner&rsquo;s notoriety through the Principality.&nbsp; Further
than this, we need not suppose they troubled the great man much;
uncomplainingly he went on, for he loved his Master, and he loved
his work.&nbsp; He only remembered that a certain sum must be
found by such a day to pay off a certain portion of a
chapel-debt; he had to meet the emergency, and he could only meet
it by obtaining help from his brethren.</p>
<p>In this way he travelled from North to South Wales forty
times; he preached always once every day in the week, and twice
on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; Of course, the congregations
everywhere welcomed him; the collections usually would be but
very small; ministers and officers, more usually, as far as was
possible, somewhat resented these calls, as too frequent and
irregular.&nbsp; He preached one of his own glorious sermons, and
then&mdash;does it not seem shocking to us to know, that he
usually stood at the door, as it were, hat in hand, to receive
such contributions as the friends might give to him?&nbsp; And he
did this for many years, until, at last, his frequent
indisposition, in consequence of this severity of service,
compelled him to ask some friend to take his place at the door;
but in doing this he always apologised for his delegation of
service to another, lest it should seem that he had treated with
inattention and disrespect those who had contributed to him of
their love and kindness.</p>
<p>And so a number of the Welsh Baptist chapels, in <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Anglesea
and North Wales, rose.&nbsp; There was frequently a loud outcry
among the ministers of the south, that he came too often; and
certainly it was only the marvellous attractions of the preacher
which saved him from the indignity of a refusal.&nbsp; His reply
was always ready: &ldquo;What can I do? the people crowd to hear
us; it is our duty to accommodate them as well as we can; all we
have we give; to you much is given, you can give much; it is more
blessed to give than receive,&rdquo; etc., etc.&nbsp; Then
sometimes came more plaintive words; and so he won his way into
the pulpit, and, once there, it was not difficult to win his way
to the people&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; It was what we suppose may be
called the age of chapel cases.&nbsp; How many of our chapels in
England have been erected by the humiliating travels of poor
ministers?</p>
<p>Christmas Evans was saved from one greater indignity yet, the
encountering the proud rich man, insolent, haughty, and
arrogant.&nbsp; It is not a beautiful chapter in the history of
voluntaryism.&nbsp; In the course of these excursions, he usually
succeeded in accomplishing the purpose for which he set forth;
probably the contributions were generally very small; but then,
on many occasions, the preacher had so succeeded in putting
himself on good terms with all his hearers that most of them gave
something.</p>
<p>It is said that on one occasion not a single person passed by
without contributing something: surely a most unusual
circumstance, but it was the result of a man&oelig;uvre.&nbsp; It
was in an obscure district, just then especially remarkable for
sheep-stealing; indeed, it was quite notorious.&nbsp; The
preacher was aware of this circumstance, and, when he stood up in
the immense <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>crowd to urge the people to liberality, he spoke of
this crime of the neighbourhood; he supposed that amidst that
large multitude it was impossible but that some of those
sheep-stealers would be present: he addressed them solemnly, and
implored them, if present, not to give anything to the collection
about to be made.&nbsp; It was indeed a feat rather worthy of
Rowland Hill than illustrative of Christmas Evans, but so it was;
those who had no money upon them borrowed from those who had, and
it is said that, upon that occasion, not a single person
permitted himself to pass out without a contribution.</p>
<p>The good man, however, often felt that a burden was laid upon
him, which scarcely belonged to the work to which he regarded
himself as especially set apart.&nbsp; Perhaps he might have
paraphrased the words of the Apostle, and said, &ldquo;The Lord
sent me not to attend to the affairs of your chapel-debts, but to
preach the gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is not only pathos, but
truth in the following words; he says, &ldquo;I humbly think that
no missionaries in India, or any other country, have had to bear
such a burden as I have borne, because of chapel-debts, and
<i>they</i> have not had besides to provide for their own
support, as I have had to do through all my life in Anglesea;
London committees have cared for <i>them</i>, while I, for many
years, received but seventeen pounds per annum for all my
services.&nbsp; The other preachers were young, and
inexperienced, and the members threw all the responsibility upon
me, as children do upon a father; my anxiety often moved me in
the depths of the night to cry out unto God to preserve His cause
from shame.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s promises to sustain His cause in
the world greatly <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>comforted me.&nbsp; I would search for the Divine
promises to this effect, and plead them in prayer, until I felt
as confident as if every farthing had been paid.&nbsp; I laboured
hard to institute weekly penny offerings, but was not very
successful; and after every effort there remained large sums
unpaid in connection with some of the chapels which had been
built without my consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Christmas!&nbsp; As we read of him he excites our
wonder.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Passing rich with forty pounds a
year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>looks like positive wealth as compared with the emoluments of
our poor preacher; and yet the record is that he was given to
hospitality, and he contributed his sovereign, and
half-sovereign, not only occasionally, but annually, where his
richer neighbours satisfied their consciences with far inferior
bequests.&nbsp; How did the man do it?&nbsp; He had not married a
rich wife, and he did not, as many of his brethren, eke out his
income by some farm, or secular pursuit; a very common, and a
very necessary thing to do, we should say, in Wales.</p>
<p>But, no doubt, Catherine had much to do with his unburdened
life of domestic quiet; perhaps,&mdash;it does not appear, but it
seems probable&mdash;she had some little money of her own; she
had what to her husband was incomparably more valuable, a clear
practical mind, rich in faith, but a calm, quiet, household
faith.&nbsp; Lonely indeed her life must often have been in the
solitary cottage, into which, assuredly, nothing in the shape of
a luxury ever intruded itself.&nbsp; It has been called, by a
Welshman, a curious anomaly <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in Welsh life, the insatiable
appetite for sermons, and the singular, even marvellous,
disregard for the temporal comforts of the preacher.&nbsp;
Christmas, it seems to us, was able to bear much very
unrepiningly, but sometimes his righteous soul was vexed.&nbsp;
Upon one occasion, when, after preaching from home, he not only
received less for his expenses than he naturally expected, but
even less than an ordinary itinerant fee, an old dame remarked to
him, &ldquo;Well, Christmas, <i>bach</i>, you have given us a
wonderful sermon, and I hope you will be paid at the
resurrection,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, <i>shan fach</i>,&rdquo;
said the preacher, &ldquo;no doubt of that, but what am I to do
till I get there?&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s the old white mare that
carries me, what will she do? for her there will be no
resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly the Welsh of that day seemed to think that it was
essential to the preservation of the purity of the Gospel that
their ministers should be kept low.&nbsp; Mr. D. M. Evans, in his
Life of Christmas Evans, gives us the anecdote of a worthy and
popular minister of this time, who was in the receipt of exactly
twenty pounds a year; he received an invitation from another
Church, offering him three pounds ten a month.&nbsp; This
miserable lover of filthy lucre, like another Demas, was tempted
by the dazzling offer, and intimated his serious intention of
accepting &ldquo;the call.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a great
commotion in the neighbourhood, where the poor man was
exceedingly beloved; many of his people remonstrated with him on
the sad exhibition he was giving of a guilty love of money; and,
after much consideration, the leading deacon was appointed as a
deputation to wait upon him, and to inform him, that <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>rather than
suffer the loss of his removal on account of money
considerations, they had agreed to advance his salary to twenty
guineas, or twenty-one pounds!&nbsp; Overcome by such an
expression of his people&rsquo;s attachment, says Mr. Evans, he
repented of his incontinent love of money, and stayed.</p>
<p>A strange part-glimpse all this seems to give of Welsh
clerical life, not calculated either to kindle, or to keep in a
minister&rsquo;s mind, the essential sense of self-respect.&nbsp;
The brothers of La Trappe, St. Francis and his preaching friars,
do not seem to us a more humiliated tribe than Christmas and his
itinerating &ldquo;little <i>brethren</i> of the
poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; We suppose that sometimes a farmer would send
a cheese, and another a few pounds of butter, and another a
flitch of bacon; and, perhaps, occasionally, in the course of his
travels,&mdash;we do not know of any such instances, we only
suppose it possible, and probable,&mdash;some rich man, after an
eloquent sermon, would graciously patronize the illustrious
preacher, by pressing a real golden sovereign into the
apostle&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>One wonders how clothes were provided.&nbsp; William
Huntingdon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bank of Faith&rdquo; seems to us, in
comparison with that of Christmas Evans, like the faith of a man
who wakes every morning to the sense of the possession of a
million sterling at his banker&rsquo;s,&mdash;in comparison with
<i>his</i> faith, who rises sensible that, from day to day, he
has to live as on the assurance, and confidence of a child.</p>
<p>Certainly, Wales did not contain at that time a more
unselfish, and divinely thoughtless creature than this Christmas
Evans; and then he had no children.&nbsp; A man without children,
without a child, can afford to <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>be more careless and indifferent to
the world&rsquo;s gold and gear.&nbsp; The coat, no doubt, often
got very shabby, and the mothers of Israel in Anglesea, let us
hope, sometimes gathered together, and thought of pleasant
surprises in the way of improving the personal appearance of
their pastor; but indeed the man was ridiculous in his disregard
to all the circumstances of dress and adornment.&nbsp; Once, when
he was about to set forth on a preaching tour, Catherine had
found her mind greatly exercised concerning her husband&rsquo;s
hat, and, with some difficulty, she had succeeded in equipping
that noble head of his with a new one.&nbsp; But upon the journey
there came a time when his horse needed to drink; at last he came
to a clear, and pleasant pond, or brook, but he was at a loss for
a pail; now what was to be done?&nbsp; Happy thought, equal to
any of those of Mr. Barnand! he took the hat from off his head,
and filled it with water for poor old Lemon.&nbsp; When he
returned home, Catherine was amazed at the deterioration of the
headgear, and he related to her the story.&nbsp; A man like this
would not be likely to be greatly troubled by any defections in
personal adornment.</p>
<p>Wordsworth has chanted, in well-remembered lines, the name and
fame of him, whom he designates, for his life of probity, purity,
and poverty,&mdash;united in the pastoral office, in his mountain
chapel in Westmoreland,&mdash;Wonderful Robert Walker.&nbsp; Far
be it from us to attempt to detract from the well-won honours of
the holy Westmoreland pastor; but, assuredly, as we think of
Christmas Evans, he too seems to us even far more wonderful; for
there was laid upon him, not merely the thought for his own
pulpit and his own <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>family, but the care of all the Churches in his
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>And so the end is, that during these years we have to follow
him through mountain villages, in which the silence and
desolation greet him, like that he might have found in old
Castile, or La Mancha,&mdash;through spots where ruined old
castles and monasteries were turned into barns, and hay and straw
stowed away within walls, once devoted either to gorgeous
festivity or idolatry,&mdash;through wild and beautiful scenes;
narrow glen and ravine, down which mountain torrents roared and
foamed,&mdash;through wild mountain gorges, far, in his day, from
the noise and traffic of towns,&mdash;although in such spots Mr.
Borrow found the dark hills strangely ablaze with furnaces,
seeming to that strange traveller, so he said, queerly enough,
&ldquo;like a Sabbath in hell, and devils proceeding to afternoon
worship,&rdquo;&mdash;past simple, and unadorned, and spireless
churches, hallowed by the prayers of many generations; and
through churchyards in which rests the dust of the venerable
dead.&nbsp; We can see him coming to the lonely Methodist chapel,
rising like a Shiloh, bearing the ark, like a lighthouse among
the high hills&mdash;strolling into a solitary cottage as he
passes, and finding some ancient woman, in her comfortable
kitchen, over her Welsh Bible, and concordance, neither an
unpleasant nor an unusual sight;&mdash;never happier, we will be
bold to say, than when, keeping his own company, he traverses and
travels these lone and solitary roads and mountain by-paths, not
only through the long day, but far into the night, sometimes by
the bright clear moonlight, among the mountains, and sometimes
through the &ldquo;villain mists,&rdquo; <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>their large
sheets rolling up the mountain sides bushes and trees seen
indistinctly like goblins and elves, till&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In every hollow dingle stood,<br />
Of wry-mouth fiends a wrathful brood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we think of him pressing on his way; no doubt often
drenched to the skin, although uninjured in body; sometimes
through scenes novel and grand, where the mountain looks sad with
some ruin on its brow, as beneath Cader Idris (the chair or
throne of Idris), where the meditative wanderer might conceive he
saw some old king, unfortunate and melancholy, but a king still,
with the look of a king, and the ancestral crown on his
forehead.</p>
<p>We may be sure he came where corpse-candles glittered,
unquenched by nineteenth-century ideas, along the road; for those
travelling times were much nearer to the days of Twm &oacute;r
Nant, who, when he kept turnpike, was constantly troubled by
hearses, and mourning coaches, and funeral processions on foot
passing through his gate.&nbsp; Through lonely places and alder
swamps, where nothing would be heard but the murmuring of waters,
and the wind rushing down the gullies,&mdash;sometimes falling in
with a pious and sympathetic traveller, a lonely creature,
&ldquo;Sorry to say, Good-bye, thank you for your conversation; I
haven&rsquo;t heard such a treat of talk for many a weary
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Often, passing through scenes where the sweet
voice of village bells mingled with the low rush of the river;
and sometimes where the rocks rolled back the echoes like a pack
of dogs sweeping down the hills.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hark to the
dogs!&rdquo; exclaimed a companion to Mr. Borrow once.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This pass is called <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span><i>Nant yr ieuanc gwn</i>, the pass
of the young dogs; because, when one shouts, it answers with a
noise resembling the crying of hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What honour was paid to the name and memory of the
earnest-hearted and intrepid Felix Neff, the pastor of the Higher
Alps; but does not the reader, familiar with the life of that
holy man, perceive much resemblance in the work, the endurance,
and the scenery of the toil, to that of Christmas Evans?&nbsp;
May he not be called the pastor of our English Engadine?</p>
<p>All such lives have their grand compensations; doubtless this
man had his, and <i>great</i> compensations too; perhaps, among
the minor ones, we may mention his ardent reception at the great
Association gatherings.&nbsp; At these his name created great
expectations; there he met crowds of brethren and friends, from
the remote parts of the Principality, by whom he was at once
honoured and loved.&nbsp; We may conceive such an occasion; the
&ldquo;one-eyed man of Anglesea&rdquo; has now been for many
years at the very height of his popularity; his name is now the
greatest in his denomination; this will be one of his great
occasions, and his coming has been expected for many weeks.&nbsp;
No expectation hanging upon the appearance of Jenny Lind, or
Christine Nielson, or Sims Reeves, on some great musical
festivity, can reach, in our imagination, the expectations of
these poor, simple villagers as they think of the delight they
will experience in listening to their wonderful and well-loved
prophet.</p>
<p>So, along all the roads, there presses an untiring crowd,
showing that something unusual is going on <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>somewhere.&nbsp; The roads are all picturesque and
lively with all sorts of people, on foot, on horseback, in old
farm carts, and even in carriages; all wending their way to the
largest and most central chapel of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is
the chief service.&nbsp; It is a Sabbath evening; the
congregation is wedged together in the spacious house of God; it
becomes almost insupportable, but the Welsh like it.&nbsp; The
service has not commenced, and a cry is already raised that it
had better be held in an adjoining field; but it is said this
would be inconvenient.&nbsp; The doors, the windows, are all
thrown open; and so the time goes on, and the hour for the
commencement of the service arrives.&nbsp; All eyes are strained
as the door opens beneath the pulpit, and the minister of the
congregation comes in, and makes his way, as well as he can, for
himself and his friend, the great preacher&mdash;there he is!
that tall, commanding figure,&mdash;that is he, the
&ldquo;one-eyed man of Anglesea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of joy, whisperings of glad congratulation, which
almost want to burst into acclamations, pass over the
multitude.&nbsp; And the service commences with prayer, singing,
reading a chapter, and a short sermon,&mdash;a very short one,
only twenty minutes.&nbsp; There are crowds of preachers sitting
beneath the pulpit, but they, and all, have come to hear the
mighty minstrel&mdash;and the moment is here.&nbsp; A few more
verses of a hymn, during which there is no little commotion, in
order that there may be none by-and-bye, those who have been long
standing changing places with those who had been sitting.&nbsp;
There, he is up! he is before the people!&nbsp; And in <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>some such
circumstances he seems to have first sung that wonderful song or
sermon,</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Demoniac of Gadara</span>.</h3>
<p>The text he announced was&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Jesus said unto
him</i>, <i>Go home unto thy friends</i>, <i>and tell them how
great things the Lord hath done for thee</i>, <i>and hath had
compassion on thee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The introduction was very simple and brief; but, before long,
the preacher broke loose from all relations of mere comment and
explanation, and seemed to revel in dramatic scenery, and
pictorial imagination, and, as was so usual with him in such
descriptions, increasing, heightening, and intensifying the
picture, by making each picture, each scene, to live even in the
kind of enchantment of a present demoniacal possession.&nbsp; He
began by describing the demoniac as a castle garrisoned with a
legion of fiends, towards which the great Conqueror was
approaching over the Sea of Tiberias, the winds hushing at His
word, the sea growing calm at His bidding.&nbsp; Already He had
acquired among the devils a terrible fame, and His name shook the
garrison of the entire man, and the infernal legion within, with
confusion and horror.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this
demoniac was not only an object of pity, but he was really a
terror to the country.&nbsp; So terrific was his appearance, so
dreadful and hideous his screams, so formidable, frightful, and
horrid his wild career, that all the women in that region were so
much alarmed that none of them dared go to market, lest he should
leap upon them like a panther on his prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what made him still more terrible was the place of
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>his
abode.&nbsp; It was not in a city, where some attention might be
paid to order and decorum (though he would sometimes ramble into
the city, as in this case).&nbsp; It was not in a town, or
village, or any house whatever, where assistance might be
obtained in case of necessity; but it was among the tombs, and in
the wilderness&mdash;not far, however, from the turnpike
road.&nbsp; No one could tell but that he might leap at them,
like a wild beast, and scare them to death.&nbsp; The gloominess
of the place made it more awful and solemn.&nbsp; It was among
the tombs&mdash;where, in the opinion of some, all witches,
corpse-candles, and hobgoblins abide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, however, Mary was determined that no such
nuisance should be suffered in the country of the
Gadarenes.&nbsp; The man must be clothed, though he was mad and
crazy.&nbsp; And if he should at any future time strip himself,
tie up his clothes in a bundle, throw them into the river, and
tell them to go to see Abraham, he must be tied and taken care
of.&nbsp; Well, this was all right; no sooner said than
done.&nbsp; But, so soon as the fellow was bound, although even
in chains and fetters, Samson-like he broke the bands asunder,
and could not be tamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time, the devil became offended with the
Gadarenes, and, in a pout, he took the demoniac away, and drove
him into the wilderness.&nbsp; He thought the Gadarenes had no
business to interfere, and meddle with his property; for he had
possession of the man.&nbsp; And he knew that &lsquo;a bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is probable
that he wanted to send him home; for there was no knowing what
might happen now-a-days.&nbsp; But there was too much matter
about him to send him as he was; therefore, he thought the best
plan would be to persuade him to commit suicide by cutting his
throat.&nbsp; But here Satan was at a nonplus&mdash;his rope was
too short.&nbsp; He could not turn executioner himself, as that
would not have answered the design he has in view, when he wants
people to commit suicide; for the act would have been his own
sin, and not the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>The poor demoniac, therefore, must
go about to hunt for a sharp stone, or anything that he could
get.&nbsp; He might have been in search of such an article, when
he returned from the wilderness into the city, whence he came,
when he met the Son of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
man.&nbsp; And when he saw Jesus he cried out, and fell down
before him, and with a loud voice said, &lsquo;What have I to do
with thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most high?&nbsp; I beseech
Thee, torment me not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the devil&rsquo;s confession of faith.&nbsp;
The devils believe and tremble, while men make a mock of sin, and
sport on the brink of eternal ruin.&nbsp; To many of the human
race, Christ appears as a root out of dry ground.&nbsp; They see
in Him neither form nor comeliness, and there is no beauty in Him
that they should desire Him.&nbsp; Some said He was the
carpenter&rsquo;s son, and would not believe in Him; others said
He had a devil, and that it was through Beelzebub, the chief of
the devils, that He cast out devils: some cried out, &lsquo;Let
Him be crucified;&rsquo; and others said, &lsquo;Let His blood be
on us and on our children.&rsquo;&nbsp; As the Jews would not
have Him to reign over them, so many, who call themselves
Christians, say that He is a mere man; as such, He has no right
to rule over their consciences, and demand their obedience,
adoration, and praise.&nbsp; But the devils know
better&mdash;they say, Jesus is the Son of God most high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the children of the devil, whose work they do,
differ very widely from their father in their sentiments
respecting the person of Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus commanded the legion of unclean spirits to come
out of the man.&nbsp; They knew that out they must go.&nbsp; But
they were like Irishmen&mdash;very unwilling to return to their
own country.&nbsp; They would rather go into hogs&rsquo; skins
than to their own country.&nbsp; And He suffered them to go into
the herd of swine.&nbsp; Methinks that one of the men who fed the
hogs, kept a better look out than the rest of them <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and said,
&lsquo;What ails the hogs?&nbsp; Look sharp there,
boys&mdash;keep them in&mdash;make good use of your whips!&nbsp;
Why don&rsquo;t you run?&nbsp; Why, I declare, one of them has
gone over the cliff!&nbsp; There, there, Morgan, goes
another!&nbsp; Drive them back, Tom.&rsquo;&nbsp; Never was there
such a running, and whipping, and hallooing; but down go the
hogs, before they are aware of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them said, &lsquo;They are all gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sure not all gone into the sea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, every one of them, the <i>black hog</i> and
all.&nbsp; They are all drowned! the devil is in them!&nbsp; What
shall we do now?&nbsp; What can we say to the owners?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What can we say?&rsquo; said another; &lsquo;we
must tell the truth&mdash;that is all about it.&nbsp; We did our
best&mdash;all that was in our power.&nbsp; What could any man do
more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they went their way to the city, to tell the masters
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;John, where are you going?&rsquo; exclaimed one
of the masters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, did you know the demoniac that was among
the tombs there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Demoniac among the tombs!&nbsp; Where did you
leave the hogs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That madman, sir&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Madman!&nbsp; Why do you come home without the
hogs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That wild and furious man, sir, that mistress
was afraid of so much&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, John, I ask you a plain and simple
question&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you answer me?&nbsp; Where are the
hogs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That man who was possessed with the devils,
sir&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, sure enough, you are crazy!&nbsp; You look
wild!&nbsp; Tell me your story, if you can, let it be what it
may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jesus Christ, sir, has cast the unclean spirits
out of the demoniac; they are gone into the swine; and they are
all drowned in the sea; for I saw the tail of the last
one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gadarenes went out to see what was done, and <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>finding
that it was even so, they were afraid, and besought Jesus to
depart from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How awful must be the condition of those men who love
the things of this world more than Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man out of whom the unclean spirits were cast,
besought Jesus that he might be with Him.&nbsp; But He told him
to return to his own house, and show how great things God had
done unto him.&nbsp; And he went his way, and published,
throughout the whole city of Decapolis, how great things Jesus
had done unto him.&nbsp; The act of Jesus casting so many devils
out of him, was sufficient to persuade him that Jesus was God as
well as man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine I see him going through the city,
crying&mdash;&lsquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; Oh yes! please to
take notice of me, the demoniac among the tombs.&nbsp; I am the
man who was a terror to the people of this place&mdash;that wild
man, who would wear no clothes, and that no man could bind.&nbsp;
Here am I now, in my right mind.&nbsp; Jesus Christ, the Friend
of sinners, had compassion on me.&nbsp; He remembered me when I
was in my low estate&mdash;when there was no eye to pity, and no
hand to save.&nbsp; He cast out the devils and redeemed my soul
from destruction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most wonderful must have been the surprise of the
people, to hear such proclamation.&nbsp; The ladies running to
the windows, the shoemakers throwing their lasts one way, and
their awls another, running out to meet him and to converse with
him, that they might be positive that there was no imposition,
and found it to be a fact that could not be contradicted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, the wonder of all wonders!&nbsp; Never was there such
a thing,&rsquo; must, I think, have been the general
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while they were talking, and everybody having
something to say, homeward goes the man.&nbsp; As soon as he
comes in sight of the house, I imagine I see one of the children
running in, and crying, &lsquo;Oh, mother! father is
coming&mdash;he will kill us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Children, come all into the house,&rsquo;
says the mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us fasten the doors.&nbsp; I
think there is no sorrow like my sorrow!&rsquo; says the
broken-hearted woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are all the windows fastened,
children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mary, my dear, come from the
window&mdash;don&rsquo;t be standing there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, mother, I can hardly believe it is
father!&nbsp; That man is well dressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes, my dear children, it is your own
father.&nbsp; I knew him by his walk, the moment I saw
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another child stepping to the window, says, &lsquo;Why,
mother, I never saw father coming home as he comes to-day.&nbsp;
He walks on the footpath, and turns round the corner of the
fence.&nbsp; He used to come towards the house as straight as a
line, over fences, ditches, and hedges; and I never saw him walk
as slowly as he does now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few moments, however, he arrives at the door of
the house, to the great terror and consternation of all the
inmates.&nbsp; He gently tries the door, and finds no
admittance.&nbsp; He pauses a moment, steps towards the window,
and says in a low, firm, and melodious voice, &lsquo;My dear
wife, if you will let me in, there is no danger.&nbsp; I will not
hurt you.&nbsp; I bring you glad tidings of great
joy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The door is reluctantly opened, as it were
between joy and fear.&nbsp; Having deliberately seated himself,
he says: &lsquo;I am come to show you what great things God has
done for me.&nbsp; He loved me with an everlasting love.&nbsp; He
redeemed me from the curse of the law, and the threatenings of
vindictive justice.&nbsp; He saved me from the power and dominion
of sin.&nbsp; He cast the devils out of my heart, and made that
heart, which was a den of thieves, the temple of the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how much I love my Saviour.&nbsp;
Jesus Christ is the foundation of my hope, the object of my
faith, and the centre of my affections.&nbsp; I can venture my
immortal soul upon Him.&nbsp; He is my best friend.&nbsp; He is
altogether <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>lovely&mdash;the chief among ten thousand.&nbsp; He is
my wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.&nbsp;
There is enough in Him to make a poor sinner rich, and a
miserable sinner happy.&nbsp; His flesh and blood is my
food,&mdash;His righteousness my wedding garment, and His blood
is efficacious to cleanse me from all my sins.&nbsp; Through Him
I can obtain eternal life; for He is the brightness of the
Father&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of His Person: in
whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&nbsp; He
deserves my highest esteem, and my warmest gratitude.&nbsp; Unto
Him who loved me with an eternal love, and washed me in His own
blood, unto Him be the glory, dominion, and power, for ever and
ever!&nbsp; For He has rescued my soul from hell.&nbsp; He
plucked me as a brand from the burning.&nbsp; He took me out of
the miry clay, and out of a horrible pit.&nbsp; He set my feet
upon a rock, and established my goings, and put in my mouth a new
song of praise, and glory to Him!&nbsp; Glory to Him for
ever!&nbsp; Glory to God in the highest!&nbsp; Glory to God for
ever and ever!&nbsp; Let the whole earth praise Him!&nbsp; Yea,
let all the people praise Him!&rsquo;&nbsp; How sweet was all
this, the transporting joy of his wife!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beyond the power of the strongest imagination to
conceive the joy and gladness of this family.&nbsp; The joy of
seafaring men delivered from shipwreck; the joy of a man
delivered from a burning house; the joy of not being found guilty
at a criminal bar; the joy of receiving pardon to a condemned
malefactor; the joy of freedom to a prisoner of war, is nothing
in comparison to the joy of him who is delivered from going down
to the pit of eternal destruction.&nbsp; For it is a joy
unspeakable and full of glory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of this sermon is described as overwhelmingly
wonderful.&nbsp; The first portion, in which he <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>pictured
the mysterious and terrible being, the wild demoniac, something
of a wild beast, and something of a fiend, made the people
shudder.&nbsp; Then, shifting his scene, the catastrophe of the
swine, the flight of the affrighted herdsmen, the report to the
master, and the effect of the miracle on the populace, was
rendered with such dramatic effect, the preacher even laughing
himself, as he painted the rushing swine, hurrying down the steep
place into the lake, especially the &ldquo;black hog,&rdquo; and
all,&mdash;for they all understood the point of that
allusion,&mdash;that beneath the grim grotesqueness of the scene,
laughter ran over the whole multitude.&nbsp; But the pathos of
the family scene!&nbsp; Mary embracing her restored husband; and
the restored maniac&rsquo;s experience, and hymn of praise.&nbsp;
The place became a perfect Bochim; they wept like mourners at a
funeral.&nbsp; Shouts of prayer and praise mingled
together.&nbsp; One who heard that wonderful sermon says, that,
at last, the people seemed like the inhabitants of a city which
had been shaken by an earthquake, that, in their escape, rushed
into the streets, falling upon the earth screaming, and calling
upon God!</p>
<p>This sermon has never been printed; indeed, it is obvious that
it never could be prepared for the press.&nbsp; It defies all
criticism; and the few outlines we have attempted to present are
quite inadequate to reproduce it.&nbsp; All who heard it
understood, that it was a picture of a lunatic, and demon-haunted
world; and it was beneath the impression of this, that passionate
cries, universal, thankful, penitent murmurs rose; whilst amidst
loud &ldquo;Amens!&rdquo; and sobs, and tears, some petitions
ascended: &ldquo;O Lord, who didst walk <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>on the sea,
that Thou mightest meet the Gadarene, cast out some demons from
our midst to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the demoniac of Gadara is not, in the strict sense of
the word, an allegory, yet it is allegoric throughout; a fine
piece of shadowy painting, in which unconverted, and converted
men, and women might realize something of their own personal
history, and the means by which they would &ldquo;come to
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, no doubt, the chief charm, and most original
characteristic of the preacher, was his power of sustained
allegory; some incident, even some passing expression in
Scripture, some prophetic figure of speech, was turned round and
round by him, beaten out, or suggested a series of cartoon
paintings, until it became like a chapter from the
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has seemed to
us, that his translators have been singularly unfortunate in
rendering these excursions of his fancy into English; our most
vivid impressions of them have been derived from those who had
heard them, in all their freshness, from the preacher&rsquo;s own
wonderful lips.&nbsp; We will attempt to transfer one or two of
these allegories to our pages.&nbsp; It must have been effective
to have heard him describe the necessity of Divine life,
spiritual power, to raise a soul from spiritual death.&nbsp; This
may be called</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Four Methods of
Preaching</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He beheld,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;such a
one as Lazarus lying in the cave, locked in the sleep of death;
now how shall he be raised? how shall he be brought back to
life?&nbsp; Who will roll away for us the stone from this
sepulchre?&nbsp; First came one, who went down to the cave with
blankets, and salt, to <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>rub with the fomentations of duty,
to appeal to the will, to say to the sleeping man, that he could
if he would; chafing and rubbing the cold and inert limbs, he
thinks to call back the vital warmth; and then retiring, and
standing some distance apart, he says to the other spectators,
&lsquo;Do you not see him stir?&nbsp; Are there no signs of
life?&nbsp; Is he not moving?&rsquo;&nbsp; No, he lies very
still, there is no motion.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise? how
could a sense of moral duty be felt by the man
there?&mdash;<i>for the man was dead</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first man gave up in despair.&nbsp; And then came
the second.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you would never do it,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;but if you look at me, you will see a
thing.&nbsp; No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;your treatment has been
too gentle.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he went down into the cave with a
scourge.&nbsp; Said he, &lsquo;The man only wants severe
treatment to be brought back to life.&nbsp; I warrant me I will
make him feel,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; And he laid on in quick
succession the fervid blows, the sharp threatenings of law and
judgment, and future danger and doom; and then he retired to some
distance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is he not waking?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you not see the corpse stir?&rsquo;&nbsp; No!&nbsp; A
corpse he was before the man began to lay on his lashes, and a
corpse he continued still;&mdash;<i>for the man was dead</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said another, advancing, &lsquo;but I
have wonderful power.&nbsp; You, with your rubbing, and your
smiting, what can you do? but I have it, for I have two
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he advanced, and he fixed an electric
battery, and disposed it so that it touched the dead man, and
then, from a flute which he held, he drew forth such sweet sounds
that they charmed the ears which were listening; and whether it
was the battery, or whether it was the music, so it was, that
effect seemed to be produced.&nbsp; &lsquo;Behold,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;what the refinements of education and cultivation will
do!&rsquo;&nbsp; And, indeed, so it was, for the hair of the dead
man seemed to rise, and his eye-balls seemed to start and dilate;
and see! he rises, starts up, and takes a stride down the
cave.&nbsp; Ah, but it is all over; it was nothing but the
electricity in the battery; and he sank <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>back again
flat on the floor of the cave;&mdash;<i>for the man was
dead</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when all were filled with despair, there came
One, and stood by the entrance of the cave; but He was the Lord
and Giver of life, and standing there, He said, &lsquo;Come from
the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon this slain one, that
he may live.&nbsp; Christ hath given thee life.&nbsp; Awake, thou
that sleepest.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the man arose; he shook off his
grave-clothes; what he needed had come to him
now&mdash;<i>life</i>!&nbsp; Life is the only cure for
death.&nbsp; Not the prescriptions of duty, not the threats of
punishment and damnation, not the arts and the refinements of
education, but new, spiritual, Divine <i>life</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same manner appears in the way in which he traces the
story of a soul seeking Christ, under the idea of the Wise Men
following the leading star in</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Seeking the Young
Child</span>.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>We have remarked before that the preacher&rsquo;s descriptions
of Oriental travel were always Welsh, and this could not arise so
much from ignorance, for he was fairly well read in the
geography, and, perhaps, even in the topography, of the Holy
Land; but he was quite aware that Oriental description would be
altogether incomprehensible to the great multitude of his
auditors.&nbsp; He described, therefore, the Wise Men, not as we,
perhaps, see them, on their camels, solemnly pacing the vast
sandy desert, whose sands reflected the glow of the silvery
star.&nbsp; They passed on their way through scenes, and
villages, which might be recognised by the hearers, anxiously
enquiring for the young Child.&nbsp; Turnpikes, if unknown in
Palestine, our readers will, perhaps, remember as one of the <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>great
nuisances of even a very short journey in Wales in
Christmas&rsquo;s day.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wise men came up to the gate,&mdash;it
was closed; they spoke to the keeper, inquiring, &lsquo;Do you
know anything of the Child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gatekeeper came to the door, saying, in answer to
the question, &lsquo;You have threepence to pay for each of the
asses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They explained, &lsquo;We did not know there was
anything to pay; here is the money; but tell us, do you know
anything of the young Child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the keeper did not even know what they meant.&nbsp;
For they know nothing on the world&rsquo;s great highway of the
Child sent for the redemption of man.&nbsp; But he said,
&lsquo;You go on a little farther, and you will come to a
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop; he has all the news, he knows
everything, and he will be sure to be able to tell you all you
want to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they paced along the road, following the star, till
they came to the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop; and it was very full,
and the blacksmith was very busy, but they spoke out loudly to
him, and said, &lsquo;Where is the young Child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the blacksmith, &lsquo;it is of
no use shouting that way; you must wait, you see I am busy; your
asses cannot be shod for a couple of hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, you mistake us,&rsquo; said the wise men;
&lsquo;we do not want our asses shod, but we want you to tell us,
you, who know everything hereabouts, where shall we find the
young Child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said the blacksmith.&nbsp;
For the world, in its bustle and trade, knows nothing, and cares
nothing about the holy Child Jesus.&nbsp; &lsquo;But look
you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;go on, and you will come to the inn,
the great public-house; everybody from the village goes there,
they know all the news there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, with heavy hearts, they still pursued their way
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>till
they came to the inn; at the door, still resting on their asses,
they inquired if any one knew of the Child, the wonderful
Child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the landlord said, &lsquo;Be quick!&nbsp; Evan,
John, where are you? bring out the ale&mdash;the porter&mdash;for
these gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;we are too anxious
to refresh ourselves; but tell us, hereabouts has been born the
wonderful Child; He is the desire of all the nations; look there,
we have seen His Star, we want to worship Him.&nbsp; Do you
know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; For
pleasure knows nothing of Him through whom the secrets of all
hearts are revealed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Plenty of children born
hereabouts,&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;but I know nothing
of Him whom you seek.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he thought them a little
mad, and was, moreover, a little cross because they would not
dismount and go into the inn.&nbsp; &lsquo;However,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;there is an old Rabbi lives in a lane hard by here;
I think I have heard him say something about a Child that should
be born, whose name should be called Wonderful.&nbsp; See, there
is the way, you will find the old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So again they went on their way; and they stopped
before the house of the old Rabbi, and knocked, and the door was
opened; and here they left their asses by the gate, and entered
in; and they found the old Rabbi seated with his Hebrew books,
and chronicles about him, and he was strangely attired with mitre
and vestment.&nbsp; And now, they thought, they would be sure to
learn, and that their journey might be at an end.&nbsp; And they
told him of the Star, and that the young Child was born who
should be King of the Jews, and they were come to worship
Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;He is coming,
and you shall see Him, but not now.&nbsp; You shall behold Him,
but not nigh.&nbsp; See, it is written here&mdash;a Star shall
rise out of Jacob.&nbsp; And when He comes it will be here He
will show Himself.&nbsp; Go back, and when He comes I will send
word and let you <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>know.&rsquo;&nbsp; For even religious people, and
Churches, cannot always guide seekers after God to Him whom to
know is life eternal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were not satisfied, and they said, &lsquo;No,
no, we cannot return; He is born, He is here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There has been a great mistake made,&rsquo; said
the Rabbi; &lsquo;there have been some who have said that He is
born, but it is not so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But who has said it?&rsquo; they inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he told them of another priestly man, who
lived near to the river hard by; and to him they went, and
inquired for the young Child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; he said, when they pointed him
to the Star, &lsquo;yes, through the tender mercies of our God,
the Dayspring from on high hath visited us; to give light to them
that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our steps
into the way of peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he guided them to the manger, and the Star
rested and stood over the place where the young Child was, while
they offered their gifts of gold, and frankincense, and
myrrh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the preacher, in another version which we have seen,
appears to have varied the last guide, and to have brought the
wise men, by a singular, and perfectly inadmissible anachronism,
to the man in the camel&rsquo;s hair by the river&rsquo;s brink,
who said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the
sins of the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one of the most effective of these sustained allegories,
was founded on the text which speaks of the evil &ldquo;spirit
walking through dry places, seeking rest, and finding
none.&rdquo;&nbsp; We believe we were first indebted for it, to
the old dame who entertained us nearly forty years since in the
Caerphilly Cottage.</p>
<h3><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span><span class="smcap">Satan Walking in Dry
Places</span>.</h3>
<p>The preacher appears to have been desirous of teaching the
beautiful truth, that a mind preoccupied, and inhabited by Divine
thoughts, cannot entertain an evil visitor, but is compelled to
betake himself to flight, by the strong expulsive power of Divine
affections.&nbsp; He commenced, by describing Satan as a vast and
wicked, although invisible spirit,&mdash;somehow, as Milton might
have described him; and the preacher was not unacquainted with
the grand imagery of the &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; in which
the poet describes the Evil One, when he tempts, with wandering
feet, the dark, unbottomed, infinite abyss, and, through the
palpable obscure, seeks to find out his uncouth way.&nbsp;
Christmas described him, as spreading his airy flight on
indefatigable wings, determined to insinuate himself, through the
avenues of sense, to some poor soul, and lure it to
destruction.&nbsp; And, with this end, flying through the air,
and seeking for a dwelling-place, he found himself moving over
one of those wide Welsh moors, the preacher so well knew, and had
so often travelled; and his fiery, although invisible glance,
espied a young lad, in the bloom of his days, and the strength of
his powers, sitting on the box of his cart, driving on his way to
the quarries for slate or lime.</p>
<blockquote><p>`&ldquo;&lsquo;There he is,&rsquo; said Satan;
&lsquo;his veins are full of blood, his bones are full of
marrow.&nbsp; I will cast my sparks into his bosom, and set all
his passions on fire; I will lead him on, and he shall rob his
master, and lose his place, and find another, and rob again, and
do worse; and he shall go on from worse to worse, and then his
soul shall sink, never to rise again, into the lake of
fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; But just then, as he was <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>about to
dart a fiery temptation into the heart of the youth, the evil one
heard him sing,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pilgrim through this barren land;<br />
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold me by Thy powerful hand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong deliverer,<br />
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but this is a dry place,&rsquo; said the fiery
dragon as he fled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw him pass on,&rdquo; said the preacher,
&ldquo;hovering, like a hawk or a vulture, in the air, and
casting about for a suitable place where he might nestle his
black wings; when, at the edge of the moor, he came to a lovely
valley; the hills rose round it, it was a beautiful, still,
meadow-like spot, watered by a lovely stream; and there, beneath
the eaves of a little cottage, he saw a girl, some eighteen years
of age, a flower among the flowers: she was knitting, or sewing
at the cottage door.&nbsp; Said Satan, &lsquo;She will do for me;
I will whisper the evil thought in her heart, and she shall turn
it over, and over again, until she learns to love it; and then
the evil thought shall be an evil deed; and then she shall be
obliged to leave her village, and go to the great town, and she
shall live a life of evil, all astray from the paths of my
Almighty Enemy.&nbsp; Oh, I will make her mine, and then,
by-and-bye, I will cast her over the precipices, and she shall
sink, sink into the furnace of divine wrath.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so
he hastened to approach, and dart into the mind of the maiden;
but while he was approaching, all the hills and crags seemed to
break out into singing, as her sweet voice rose, high and clear,
chanting out the words,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jesus, lover of my soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me to Thy bosom fly,<br />
While the nearer waters roll,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the tempest still is high.<br />
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Other
refuge have I none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;<br />
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still support, and comfort me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a very dry place, too,&rsquo; said the dragon,
as he fled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he passed from the valley among the hills, but
with hot rage.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will have a place to dwell
in!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I will somehow leap over the fences,
and the hedges, of the purpose, and covenant, and grace of
God.&nbsp; I do not seem to have succeeded with the young, I will
try the old;&rsquo; for passing down the village street, he saw
an old woman; she, too, was sitting at the door of her cot, and
spinning on her little wheel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Satan,
&lsquo;it will be good to lay hold of her grey hairs, and make
her taste of the lake that burneth with fire and
brimstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he descended on the eaves of the cot;
but as he approached near, he heard the trembling, quavering
voice of the aged woman murmuring to herself lowly, &lsquo;For
the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but My
kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant
of My peace be removed, saith the Lord, that hath mercy on
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the words hurt the evil one, as well as
disappointed him; they wounded him as he fled away, saying,
&lsquo;Another dry place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor Devil!&rdquo; exclaimed the preacher,
&ldquo;and he usually so very successful! but he was quite
unsuccessful that day.&nbsp; And, now, it was night, and he was
scudding about, like a bird of prey, upon his black wings, and
pouring forth his screams of rage.&nbsp; But he passed through
another little Welsh village, the white cottages gleaming out in
the white moonlight on the sloping hillside.&nbsp; And there was
a cottage, and in the upper room there was a faint light
trembling, and &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the Devil to himself,
&lsquo;Devil, thou hast been a very foolish Devil to-day, and
there, in that room, where the lamplight is, old Williams is
slowly, surely <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>wasting away.&nbsp; Over eighty, or I am mistaken; not
much mind left; and he has borne the burden and heat of the day,
as they call it.&nbsp; Thanks to me, he has had a hard time of
it; he has had very few mercies to be thankful for; he has not
found serving God, I think, a very profitable business.&nbsp;
Come, cheer up, Devil, it will be a grand thing if thou canst get
him to doubt a bit, and then to despair a bit, and then to curse
God, and die; that will make up for this day&rsquo;s
losses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he entered the room; there was the old man lying
on the poor bed, and his long, thin, wasted hands and fingers
lying on the coverlid; his eyes closed, the long silvery hair
falling over the pillow.&nbsp; Now, Satan, make haste, or it will
be too late; the hour is coming, there is even a stir in every
room in the house: they seem to know that the old man is
passing.&nbsp; But as Satan himself moved before the bed, to dart
into the mind of the old man, the patriarch rose in bed,
stretched forth his hands, and pinned his enemy to the wall, as
he exclaimed, &lsquo;Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me, Thy
rod and Thy staff they comfort me; Thou preparest a table before
me, in <i>the presence of mine enemy</i>; Thou anointest my head
with oil, my cup runneth over; goodness and mercy, all the days
of my life, dwell in the house of my God for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Oh, <i>that</i> was a fearfully dry place!&nbsp; The old man sank
back, it was all over; those words beat Satan down to the bottom
of his own bottomless pit, glad to escape from such confusion and
shame, and exclaiming, &lsquo;I will return to the place from
whence I came, for this is too dry for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will, no doubt, be thought, by many, to be strange
preaching; many would even affect to despise it,&mdash;perhaps
would even regard it as a high compliment were we to say, they
would feel exceedingly <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>puzzled even if, by way of a change,
they were called upon to use it.&nbsp; It appears, however, to
have been a style exceedingly fascinating to the Welsh mind of
that day; it told, it stirred up suggestions, awakened thoughts,
and reclaimed and converted character; and we need not,
therefore, stay to attempt any vindication of it.</p>
<p>We have inserted these very characteristic illustrations here,
because they appear to have belonged to the Anglesea
period.&nbsp; Such, then, was the teaching, the preaching, the
truth, which, while it was his own truth, and sustained his own
mind, gave to him such power, at once, amongst the Churches to
which he immediately administered, and made him the object of
such attraction, when visiting distant neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>It might have been thought&mdash;it has usually been the case,
in the instances of other men&mdash;that such excursions as those
we have described, would have interfered with the great success
of his work in the ministry as a preacher, and with his
efficiency as a pastor.&nbsp; That they did not, substantially,
is clear from many evidences.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that
his sermons were no off-hand productions; there was a careful,
rigid, and patiently conscientious weighing of their
material.&nbsp; All those which we possess, abundantly show this;
and he entered with all his heart, and mind, and strength into
the work of preaching; but he never had an easy sphere; and yet,
would his sermons have been greater had he been placed where the
circle of his labour would have been narrower, and the means of
his support more ready, and sufficient, and ample?&nbsp; Most
likely not; but he weighed the entire work of the ministry in a
manner which <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>seems to us, sometimes, more like the sound
thoughtfulness, and consideration of the theological Principal of
a college, than a popular, or itinerant preacher.&nbsp; As an
illustration of this, we may insert the following, very lengthy,
but admirable letter to a young minister, written, we believe,
some time nearer the close of his career than that we have just
depicted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Brother</span>,&mdash;1.&nbsp; Consider, in the first place, the
great importance, to a preacher, of a blameless life.&nbsp; You
must, like Timothy, &lsquo;flee youthful lusts,&rsquo; as you
would escape from beasts of prey; for there are kinds of beasts,
living in the wilderness of man&rsquo;s corruption, that will
charm, by means of their beauteous colours, those that walk among
their haunts; there is no safety but by keeping from them, and
adhering to such as live by faith, and watch, and pray.&nbsp; It
will be well for you, while you travel through the coppice of
youth, to keep from all appearance of evil.&nbsp; May you have
grace to pass through the coppice of forbidden trees, without
cutting your name into the bark of one of them, or you may be
upbraided, at critical times, by those who may wish to prove that
you are not better than themselves; even the <i>iota</i>,
inserted by your hand, may be produced after many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; I remember the words of Luther, that
<i>reading</i>, <i>prayer</i>, and <i>temptation</i> are
necessary to strengthen, and to purify the talents of a
minister.&nbsp; Read, to extend your general knowledge,
especially as to the plan of redemption, according to the
Scriptures, in all its parts, from the election to the
glorification; that you may, like a spiritual watchmaker, know
all the relative cog-wheels, and be able to open them in the
pulpit, and to connect them all by faith, hope, and charity, that
they may occupy their own places, and exhibit their true results
on the dial-plate; thus proving yourself a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, rightly <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>dividing the word of truth.&nbsp; Be
not like that thrasher, who presumptuously took his watch to
pieces in the barn, and could not put it together again, but was
obliged to carry it home in his handkerchief.&nbsp; The
messengers of God, described in the book of Revelations, are full
of eyes behind, and before.&nbsp; You must use prayer to fetch
strength out of Christ, like the homer to carry home the manna
in, or the water-pot of the woman of Samaria.&nbsp; Without the
prayer of faith, the preacher will have &lsquo;nothing to draw
with,&rsquo; from the well that is deep,&mdash;even <i>the deep
things of God</i>.&nbsp; Temptation is requisite, to prove the
nature of the metal of the preacher&rsquo;s character, and
doctrine,&mdash;&lsquo;approved of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; The piece of
gold, in every true minister&rsquo;s ministry, must be tried in
some furnace, prepared by Divine Providence.&nbsp; He must,
therefore, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil his ministry,
endure hardness, and affliction, and thus prove himself a good
soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; Avail yourself, in the morning of your days,
of every opportunity to acquire knowledge useful for the
ministry.&nbsp; Let it be your constant aim, to turn every stream
and rivulet of knowledge in the right direction, to facilitate
the work of the ministry, for the good of souls, and the glory of
God; as the bee, in all her excursions amongst the flowers of the
gardens, and the hedges, gathers honey to enrich the hive, as the
common treasury of the industrious race.&nbsp; Always have a book
to read, instead of indulging in vain conversations.&nbsp; Strive
to learn English, as you cannot have academical training.&nbsp;
Learn your own mother-tongue well.&nbsp; Learn to write a good
hand by frequent practice.&nbsp; Avoid vain conversation, instead
of growth in knowledge.&nbsp; Remember this, that you cannot
commit some loved sin in private, and perform the work of the
ministry, in public, with facility and acceptance.&nbsp; For a
preacher to fall into sin, be it a secret one, and to live in it,
is as fatal, ultimately, as the cutting of Samson&rsquo;s
hair.&nbsp; Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus
against all corruption.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; With regard to the composition of your
sermons: first, let the matter be evangelical.&nbsp; The doctrine
of the Gospel is a mould from heaven, and not changed.&nbsp; It
puts its own impress and shape on the professor that is melted
into it, so that his justification, sanctification, and all his
salvation, flow from the merits of Christ; and all through
God&rsquo;s grace, and not of ourselves.&nbsp; The gospel, as a
glass, should be kept clean and clear in the pulpit, that the
hearers may see the glory of Christ, and be changed to the same
image.&nbsp; Every duty is to be urged by evangelical
motives.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us have grace,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hereby we can serve God in all the duties of the
kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; The whole is summed up in living by
faith, which worketh by love, to him that died for us, and rose
again for our justification.&nbsp; Secondly, let your divisions
be natural to the text.&nbsp; Take care that your interpretation
accord with the contexts.&nbsp; Two or three general heads; avoid
many.&nbsp; Four or five remarks you may make on each head; see
that they are fairly in the truth of the text.&nbsp; Thirdly, I
am not inclined to make inferences, or applications, from the
whole.&nbsp; When the preacher has expended his strength, or
ingenuity, in endeavouring to impress, and apply the truth to the
minds of his hearers, application seems to me to be doing again
what has been effected already.&nbsp; The blacksmith does not put
the horse-shoe in the fire, after he has nailed it to the hoof;
and the cook does not spread the cloth again, when dinner is
over.&nbsp; Fourthly, beware of long sermons, as well as long
prayers.&nbsp; When there is but one preacher, he should not
preach for more than an hour; when there are two, both should not
be more than an hour and a half, that the worship may close
within two hours; whenever this time is passed, coolness and
fatigue ensue.&nbsp; To put three ministers to preach (in one
meeting) is a modern corruption, and likely to make some progress
in Wales; while the English, generally, have but one sermon in
one service.&nbsp; They excel us herein; for <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>we do not
read that, on the day of Pentecost, Peter, James, and John,
preached after each other; but Peter, &lsquo;<i>one</i> of the
twelve,&rsquo; delivered that successful sermon.&nbsp; When we
lose sight of the Scriptures, and common sense, we are driven to
extremes, though it be with the kindly purpose of respecting
strange ministers, by putting them to preach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; Attend, also, my young brother, to your
outward appearance in the pulpit.&nbsp; Beware of a proud,
haughty appearance, with wandering eyes, and unfeeling
countenance, so that the people utterly fail to see the man of
God in you.&nbsp; We must, in order hereunto, have something like
unto Moses, when he had been on the mount with God, that will
indicate seriousness, love to souls, a spirit of prayer, zeal for
Christ, and longing for the salvation of men; like unto those who
have felt the fear of perdition ourselves, and the infinite value
of salvation by God&rsquo;s grace; and that we wrestle with God
in order to be useful to souls.&nbsp; These things must be
imprinted on our appearance and deportment, having transformed
us, in some measure, to a heavenly form and habit.&nbsp; Our
outward conversation should be consistent herewith, or men will
despise us as hypocrites, without the fear of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; Avoid, my dear brother, all foolish bodily
gestures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; We now come to the part of the subject upon
which you are most anxious to have my thoughts: that refers <i>to
the delivery of your sermons</i>.&nbsp; It is difficult to put
general rules of rhetoric into execution.&nbsp; After reading all
that has been said by Blair, Williams, Fuller, and the Archbishop
of Cambray (Fenelon), who have spoken at length of Cicero and
Demosthenes, it is easy, by endeavouring to follow them, to lose
the spirit of the work, and thus, by seeking the form, to forfeit
the life.&nbsp; Preach the gospel of the grace of God
intelligibly, affectionately, and without shame&mdash;all the
contents of the great box, from predestination to
glorification.&nbsp; It was the closing, and concealing, of this
box that occasioned the opening of the venomous Mohammedan <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>box, as
well as that of Popery, together with all the vain legality that
is to be found among Protestants, established and
dissenting.&nbsp; It may be said, that they seek justification;
but it is by the deeds of the law.&nbsp; The locking up, and the
losing, of the doctrine of grace, through the merits of Christ,
utterly destroyed the Jewish Church; for it was in the chest,
which they locked up by their false interpolations of Scripture,
that the &lsquo;things which belong to their peace&rsquo; were
contained; &lsquo;but now,&rsquo; says the Redeemer, &lsquo;they
are concealed from their eyes;&rsquo; shut up under
unbelief.&nbsp; &lsquo;The things that pertain to their
peace&rsquo; belong also to our peace, as Gentiles.&nbsp; The
Deity of Christ, etc.; Redemption, etc.&nbsp; Excuse this
digression, for the river of God&rsquo;s throne moved me
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were upon the best mode of delivering sermons for
edification.&nbsp; It is not easy to reduce the rules of prudence
into practice.&nbsp; I have seen some men, of the highest powers,
who understood Greek better than their mother-tongue, attempting
to preach according to rule, and to them the pulpit was like unto
Gilboa; they neither affected themselves, nor their
hearers.&nbsp; The difficulty was, the bringing of their
regulations into natural practice.&nbsp; I saw one of those men,
the most eminent for learning and genius, who found the right
way, under the influence of a mighty fervency that descended upon
him in the pulpit, so that his voice became utterly different
from what it used to be, and his tongue at liberty, as though
something was cut that had hitherto restrained his tongue, and
affections, from natural exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you have the sum, and substance, and mystery of
all rules:&mdash;1. Let the preacher influence himself; let him
reach his own heart, if he would reach the hearts of others; if
he would have others feel, he must feel himself.&nbsp; Dry
shouting (or vociferation) will not do this.&nbsp; The shout of a
man who does not himself feel the effect of what he says,
hardens, instead of softening; locks, instead of opening the <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>heart.&nbsp; 2. The elevation, and fire of the voice
must accord with the fervency of the matter in the heart.&nbsp; A
person said to me once, &lsquo;Mr. Evans, you have not studied
Dr. Blair&rsquo;s Rhetoric.&rsquo;&nbsp; That man, with his
rules, was always as dry as Gilboa.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you say
so,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;when you just now saw hundreds
weeping under the sermon?&nbsp; That could not be, had I not
first of all been influenced myself, which, you know, is the
substance, and mystery, of all rules for speaking.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Wherever there is effect, there is life; and rules, without life,
have no power.&nbsp; Now, brother, follow the natural course of
affection, and voice.&nbsp; Raise not the voice while the heart
is dry; but let the heart and affections shout first; let it
commence within.&nbsp; Take this comparison:&mdash;Go to the
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop; he first puts the piece of iron in the
fire, and there is no sound of striking the anvil; he collects
together the coals for heat; then he tells the boy,
&lsquo;Blow!&rsquo; while he masterfully manages the shovel,
adjusting the coals, and asking sundry questions.&nbsp; He calmly
looks at the fire heating the iron, and does not yet take hold of
the hammer, nor order his assistants to use the sledge; but at
length, seeing that the iron has attained the proper
malleability, he takes it out, covered with sparkling fire, puts
it on the anvil, handles the hammer, and orders his workman to
take the larger one, and fashions it according to his pleasure;
and so on, all day long.&nbsp; Here, observe, he does not beat
the iron in order to make it hot, for without first heating it,
the beating process is in vain.&nbsp; Equally vain is the hammer
of vociferation, unless the matter is brought home with warmth
into our hearts.&nbsp; We have often sought to produce effect,
and to influence our hearers, much as though the smith merely put
the iron in fire, and barely warmed it; it is contrary to the
nature of things to use the hammer while the material is not duly
tempered.&nbsp; Thus I have frequently, brother, found myself in
preaching.&nbsp; You have, above, the mystery of all effective
speaking, in Parliament, at the bar, and in the pulpit;
remembering the difference <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>in the subjects, and the sources of
heat.&nbsp; In the pulpit, we speak of the deep things of God;
and we are to pray for, and to expect warmth from the Divine
Spirit.&nbsp; You complain that you cannot get your voice into a
manageable key, and yet to speak with liveliness and power.&nbsp;
Many, with a bad voice, well-governed, have become powerful
speakers; while others, with a good voice, have, in consequence
of not mastering a natural key, and not being able to move
themselves, been most ineffective speakers.&nbsp; I would direct
you to fix your voice at its natural pitch, which you may easily
do; you may then, with facility, raise and lower it according to
the subject in hand.&nbsp; If you commence in too high a key, you
cannot keep it up long.&nbsp; First, you cannot modulate it as
the occasion may require; and you fall into an unpliable, tedious
monotony, and all natural cadence, and emphasis is lost.&nbsp;
Without attuning the voice into the natural key, effective
oratory is impossible.&nbsp; Secondly, remember, not to speak in
your throat, or nostrils.&nbsp; If the former, you must soon
become hoarse, and harsh loudness follows; the glory and vivacity
are then departed, and instead of facility and cheerfulness, you
have the roarings of death&mdash;the breath failing, with forced
screams, and harsh whisperings.&nbsp; Thirdly, raise your voice
to the roof of your mouth; do not close your teeth against it,
neither imprison it in the nostrils, but open your mouth
naturally, and keep your voice within your lips, where it will
find room enough to play its high, and its low intonations, to
discourse its flats, and sharps, to utter its joys, and
sorrows.&nbsp; When you thus have your voice under control,
instead of you being under its control, dragging you about in all
disorder, you will find it your servant, running upon your
errands, up and down, all through the camp, alternating in
energy, and pliability, to the end of the sermon; and not
becoming cold and weak, scarcely bearing you through, like
Bucephalus, Alexander the Great&rsquo;s horse, which, mortally
wounded, just brought his master out of the battle, and then
expired.&nbsp; Fourthly, <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>remember, not to press too much upon
your breath, when you have attained the natural use of it, by
using very long sentences, without pausing at proper places,
which (pauses) will add to the effect, as well as preserve the
voice; so that you will be, like the smith, ready to strike the
duly-tempered metal, prepared to give the suitable emphasis at
the end of the paragraph.&nbsp; Let the matter raise the voice,
do not attempt by the voice to elevate the subject.&nbsp;
Fifthly, use words easily understood, that the people&rsquo;s
affections may not cool, while the mind is sent to a dictionary,
to understand your terms.&nbsp; The great work, the exploit of a
minister, is to win the heart to believe in Christ, and to love
Him.&nbsp; Sixthly, bear in mind, also, the necessity of keeping
the voice free, without (affected) restraint; give every
syllable, and every letter, its full and proper sound.&nbsp; (It
is one of the peculiarities and excellences of the Welsh
language, and proves its Eastern origin.)&nbsp; No letter has to
complain that it is (condemned to be) mute, and neglected, and
has no utterance.&nbsp; In English, many letters have this
complaint; but in Welsh, every letter, even as the knights at the
round table of King Arthur, has, without preference, its own
appropriate and complete sound.&nbsp; Seventhly, remember, also,
to enunciate clearly the last syllable in every Welsh word; that
will cause your most distant hearer to understand you; while,
without this, much of what you say must be inevitably lost.&nbsp;
Eighthly, in order to all this, carefully attend to the manner of
the best, and ablest preachers, and imitate, not their
weaknesses, but their excellences.&nbsp; You will observe, that
some heavenly ornament, and power from on high, are visible in
many ministers when under the Divine irradiation, which you
cannot approach to by merely imitating their artistic excellence,
without resembling them in the spiritual taste, fervency, and
zeal which Christ and his Spirit &lsquo;work in
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; This will cause, not only your being like unto
them in gracefulness of action, and propriety of elocution, but
will also induce prayer for the anointing from the Holy <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>One, which
worketh mightily in the inward man.&nbsp; This is the mystery of
all effective preaching.&nbsp; We must be endowed with power from
on high: here is the grand inward secret.&nbsp; Without this, we
(often) perceive that it is impossible, with all academic
advantages, to make good preachers of young men from any college,
in the Church of England, or among the dissenters, in the English
or the Welsh language.&nbsp; A young preacher must have the
mystery of being &lsquo;constrained&rsquo; by &lsquo;the love of
Christ&rsquo;; &lsquo;the gift of God&rsquo; must be kindled in
him; and He alone, by the Spirit, can sustain that gift by the
Holy Spirit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is sufficient for these
things?&rsquo;&nbsp; May the Lord give you, brother, a good
understanding in all things; and preserve in you the heavenly
gift by the Holy Ghost! may it be rekindled where it is, and
contributed where it is not!&nbsp; Without it, we can do nothing
for the glory of God, or the good of souls.</p>

&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Christmas Evans</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes Mr. Evans occupied such slight leisure as he could
command, by a contribution to the <i>Seren Gomer</i>, an
extensively-circulating magazine of the Principality.&nbsp;
Several of these papers are interesting; we select one,
illustrating the bent of the writer&rsquo;s mind; it was
published January 1821,&mdash;&ldquo;An inquiry into the meaning
of the singular language of the Apostle, his wish</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Be Accursed From
Christ</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For I could wish that I were
accursed (anathema) from Christ for my brethren,&rsquo; etc.
(Rom. ix. 3).&nbsp; Many things, most incredible to me, have been
said in exposition of this passage; and principally, I<span
class="smcap"> </span>think, from not observing that the word
&lsquo;anathema&rsquo; is used in two senses,&mdash;the one good,
and the other bad.&nbsp; Barclay analyses into four acceptations;
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>and,
according to the first, it signifies that which is devoted, or
set apart, to God, in a good sense.&nbsp; According to Parkhurst,
it signifies, in Luke xxi. 5, a consecrated gift, set apart for
the temple of God, and to His service alone.&nbsp; The word
translated gifts is <i>anathemasi</i>.&nbsp; In the second book
of Maccabees, ix. 8, the word denotes a consecrated gift.&nbsp;
The word in the LXX., according to Parkhurst, is synonymous with
the Hebrew word <span class="smcap">cherem</span>, and signifies,
generally, that which is entirely separated from its former
condition, and use.&nbsp; If so, why should we not understand
Paul, in the text, as expressing his ardent desire that he should
be separated, <i>a devoted thing</i>, for the conversion of his
brethren according to the flesh?&nbsp; Having gone thus far in
explanation, we offer the following interpretation: &lsquo;For I
could wish that I were <i>anathema</i>, or a gift, in my labours
as an apostle, and a preacher of the Gospel, from Christ, for the
spiritual benefit of my brethren according to the flesh,
principally, instead of being an apostle to the Gentiles, as I am
appointed; theirs is the adoption, etc.; and I could also wish
that I, also, as an apostle, were an especial gift of Christ for
their distinctive service.&rsquo;&nbsp; If this be correct, there
is no necessity for changing the tense of the verb from the
present to the perfect, and reading, &lsquo;I could wish,&rsquo;
as &lsquo;I have wished;&rsquo; while it saves us from putting in
the Apostle&rsquo;s mouth a wish entirely opposed to the
&lsquo;new creation,&rsquo; to the plan of Divine grace, and to
the glory of God; for it is certain that it is quite in
opposition to all this, for a man to desire to live in sin, and
to be accursed for ever,&mdash;and that cannot for a moment be
predicated of the Apostle of the Gentiles.&nbsp; I humbly ask
some learned correspondent, whether there is anything in the
original text with which this exposition will not harmonize.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Christmas
Evans</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter led to some unsympathetic criticism, and
reply.&nbsp; Christmas Evans wrote a vindication of <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>his former
views, which may be not uninteresting to our readers, as
illustrating a phase of his intellectual character.&nbsp; It
appeared in the <i>Seren Gomer</i> for 1822:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr.
Gomer</span>,&mdash;If you please, publish the following, in
defence of my former letter on Romans ix. 3, and in reply to your
correspondent, <i>Pen Tafar</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is admitted, on all hands, that the words in the
question express the highest degree of love to the Jews.&nbsp;
Let us, now, put the different expositions before the reader, and
then let him judge which of them contains the greatest harmony
and fitness; <i>i.e.</i>, first, to express love to the Jews;
second, the best adapted to bring about their salvation; third,
the most consistent with supreme love to Christ; and fourth,
within the confines of sinlessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; Many learned men set forth the Apostle as
having formed this desire when he was an enemy to Christ.&nbsp;
This they maintain by tracing the word <i>anathema</i> throughout
the Greek Scriptures, and the Hebrew word <i>cherem</i>, of which
it is the synonym.&nbsp; <i>Anathema</i>, they say, always
signifies &lsquo;without an exception,&rsquo; a separation, or
devotement of a beast, a city, or something else, to irredeemable
destruction (Lev. xxvii. 29).&nbsp; The devoted thing was not to
be redeemed, but certainly to be put to death (Gal. i. 9).&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Let him be accursed</i>,&rsquo; says Paul of the angel
that would preach another gospel.&nbsp; &lsquo;If any man love
not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be <i>anathema
maranatha</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;accursed when the Lord
cometh.&rsquo;&nbsp; But who <i>can</i> believe that this is the
meaning of the word in the passage before us?&nbsp; I say, with
Dr. Gill, &lsquo;This never can be the
signification.&rsquo;&nbsp; What probability is there that Paul
would swear, calling Jesus Christ to witness, to his ancient
enmity against Him?&nbsp; This was notorious enough throughout
the whole country.&nbsp; No asseveration was necessary to prove
<i>Paul&rsquo;s persecuting spirit</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, how could that which he formerly had been, <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>prove, he
now having denied himself, his old persecuting spirit, and, being
deeply ashamed on the account, prove his present love to the
Jews?&nbsp; How did his former love to Satan prove his present
love to the Jews?</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Others say that it is Paul&rsquo;s wish as a
Christian, whatever <i>anathema</i> means.&nbsp; I believe it is
his desire as a Christian; otherwise I see not how it could be an
instance of his love to his brethren according to the
flesh.&nbsp; Several authors maintain that Paul was willing,
<i>for the sake of saving his nation</i>, <i>to part with his
interest in Christ</i>, <i>and to perish for ever</i>.&nbsp;
Peter Williams and Matthew Henry give this interpretation.&nbsp;
But, seriously, how can a person persuade himself to believe
this?&nbsp; Would not the Apostle, in this case, love his nation
more than Christ, and be accordingly unworthy of Christ?&nbsp;
This is opposed to a principle of our nature, which never can
desire its own destruction; to the principle of grace, which
loves Christ above all things on earth, and in heaven.&nbsp; Such
a desire would make Paul a devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; Others suppose that Paul here speaks
inconsiderately, in a kind of ecstasy, carried away by a stream
of affection to his people.&nbsp; Who can believe this without
giving up Paul&rsquo;s inspiration, even when he solemnly appeals
to Christ?</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; Another notion is, that the Apostle was
willing, and desirous to be excommunicated from the Church of
Christ upon earth, and to be deprived of its ordinances.&nbsp;
How can this, again, be considered as consistent with love to
Christ, and His Church?&nbsp; What tendency could his leaving the
Church have to induce the Jews to enter it?&nbsp; This is
contrary to the whole course of the Divine command, and promises:
God will give His people an everlasting home, and place in His
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; Some say, it is an <i>hyperbole</i>.&nbsp; To
confirm this, Exod. xxxii. 32 is quoted as a case in point:
&lsquo;<i>Blot me</i>, <i>I pray thee</i>, <i>out of Thy
book</i>, <i>which Thou hast written</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is
not the book of eternal life, but the book of the dispensation,
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>in which
Moses was leader, and mediator.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>I
would</i>,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;<i>give up my
office</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; God rejected the request: &lsquo;Lead
the people unto the place of which I have spoken to
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not for Israel, nor a condition of
forgiveness to them, but for himself, that Moses said,
&lsquo;Blot my name out of Thy book.&rsquo;&nbsp; All this gives
but little assistance to understand the Apostle.&nbsp; The two
spiritual men do not stand on the same ground.&nbsp; Moses seeks
the obliteration of his name, unless Israel was pardoned.&nbsp;
Paul seeks a work, and an office, in order to the forgiveness of
his nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; Further, it is supposed to be proper to
modify&mdash;<i>to soften</i>&mdash;the meaning of the word
<i>anathema</i>, as signifying, sometimes, anything devoted to
God, and that never could, afterwards, be appropriated to any
other service; and here, to understand it in that softened sense,
signifying that Paul was willing for the Redeemer to make him a
devoted thing&mdash;a martyr for the truth, for the good of the
Jewish nation.&nbsp; This is substantially the opinion of Thomas
Charles, and Dr. Gill.&nbsp; Christmas Evans&rsquo;s theory is
erected on this ground&mdash;the modified sense of the word;
thus, &lsquo;I could wish myself entirely set apart, by Christ,
to the service of my people, for their spiritual good; I should
have been glad, had I my choice, to have been an Apostle,
separated to them alone, and not to the Gentiles, with my
dwelling, and labours, amongst them, and to die a martyr for the
truth, even the most horrible death that could be devised, if
Christ had appointed me hereto.&rsquo;&nbsp; If &lsquo;P.
T.&rsquo; says this is a new interpretation of Christmas
Evans&rsquo;s, the answer is, No, but a legitimate extension of a
former one; for he did not intend, nor did his words import, the
separation of martyrdom, or the most anathematised sufferings,
from Paul for his kinsmen according to the flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; Is it not plain, and does not &lsquo;P.
T.&rsquo; see, that this view is superior to the former five, and
that it takes in, and is an improving addition to the latter of
the five, as to its fitness to express the Apostle&rsquo;s great
love to his people, without <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>destroying his love to Christ, as
well as to bring about the salvation of the Jews by proper
means?&nbsp; How could the death of the Apostle contribute to the
conversion of the Jews, unless he died <i>as an apostate of the
circumcision</i>?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears to have been towards the close of the Anglesea
period, that he was thrown into a panic of fear, by a threat of a
legal prosecution, on account of some chapel debts, for which, of
course, he was regarded as responsible.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
talk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of casting me into a court of law,
where I have never been, and I hope I shall never go; but I will
cast them, first, into the court of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
have seen that he was in the habit of putting on paper his
prayers, and communions with God.&nbsp; It was a time of severe
trial to him.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I knew there was no ground of
action, but, still, I was much disturbed, being, at the time,
sixty years of age, and having, very recently, buried my
wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues, &ldquo;I received the letter at
a monthly meeting, at one of the contests with spiritual
wickedness in high places.&nbsp; On my return home, I had
fellowship with God, during the whole journey of ten miles, and,
arriving at my own house, I went upstairs to my own chamber, and
poured forth my heart before the Redeemer, who has in His hands
all authority, and power.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the following seem to
be the pathetic words in which he indulged:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O blessed Lord! in Thy merit I confide, and
trust to be heard.&nbsp; Lord, some of my brethren have run wild;
and forgetting their duty, and obligations to their father in the
Gospel, they threaten me with the law of the land.&nbsp; Weaken,
I beseech Thee, their designs in this, as Thou didst wither the
arm of Jeroboam; and soften them, as Thou didst soften <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>the mind of
Esau, and disarmed him of his warlike temper against Thy servant
Jacob, after the wrestling at Penuel.&nbsp; So disarm them, for I
do not know the length of Satan&rsquo;s chain in this case, and
in this unbrotherly attack.&nbsp; But Thou canst shorten the
chain as short as it may please Thee.&nbsp; Lord, I anticipate
them in point of law.&nbsp; They think of casting Thine unworthy
servant into the little courts here below; but I cast my cause
into the High Court, in which Thou, gracious Jesus, art the High
Chancellor.&nbsp; Receive Thou the cause of Thine unworthy
servant, and send him a writ, or a notice,
immediately&mdash;sending into their conscience, and summoning
them to consider what they are doing.&nbsp; Oh, frighten them
with a summons from Thy court, until they come, and bow in
contrition at Thy feet; and take from their hands every
revengeful weapon, and make them deliver up every gun of scandal,
and every sword of bitter words, and every spear of slanderous
expressions, and surrender them all at Thy cross.&nbsp; Forgive
them all their faults, and clothe them with white robes, and give
them oil for their heads, and the organ, and the harp of ten
strings, to sing, for the trampling of Satan under our feet by
the God of peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went up once,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and was about
ten minutes in prayer; I felt some confidence that Jesus
heard.&nbsp; I went up again with a tender heart; I could not
refrain from weeping with the joy of hope that the Lord was
drawing near to me.&nbsp; After the seventh struggle I came down,
fully believing that the Redeemer had taken my cause into His
hands, and that He would arrange, and manage for me.&nbsp; My
countenance was cheerful, as I came down the last time, like
Naaman, having washed himself seven times in the Jordan; or
Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim, having cast his burden at the foot of the
cross, into the grave of Jesus.&nbsp; I well remember the
place&mdash;the little house adjoining the meeting-house, at
Cildwrn, where I then resided&mdash;in which this struggle took
place; I can call it Penuel.&nbsp; No weapon <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>intended
against me prospered, and I had peace, at once, to my mind, and
in my (temporal) condition.&nbsp; I have frequently prayed for
those who would injure me, that they might be blessed, even as I
have been blessed.&nbsp; I know not what would have become of me,
had it not been for these furnaces in which I have been tried,
and in which the spirit of prayer has been excited, and exercised
in me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to add, that the threat was never
executed, nor did poor Christmas, apparently, hear anything
further of the matter; but we have seen how great was the
trouble, and agitation it caused him, while the fear was upon
him.&nbsp; It is very affecting to find that this great, this
saintly, and earnest minister, had upon his heart, and mind, the
burden of all the chapel-debts connected with his denomination in
Anglesea, while he was minister there.</p>
<p>It might have been thought that the ministerial course of
Christmas Evans would close in Anglesea, where he had laboured so
long, and so effectually.&nbsp; He was, now, about sixty years of
age, but there was little light just now, in the evening-time of
his life; indeed, clouds of trouble were thickening around
him.&nbsp; It often seems that trouble, in the ministerial life,
comes exactly at that moment when the life is least able to
stand, with strength, against it; and, certainly, in the life of
Christmas Evans, sorrows gathered, and multiplied at the
close.</p>
<p>Chief among these must be mentioned, beyond any doubt, the
death of the beloved companion of all the Anglesea life, his good
wife, Catherine; she left him in 1823.&nbsp; She was eminently,
and admirably fitted to be the wife of such a man as
Christmas.&nbsp; Somewhat younger than her husband, she supplied
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>many
attributes of character, to him most helpful; she was not an
enthusiast, but she was a Christian, with real, deep, and devout
convictions.&nbsp; We have no lengthy accounts of her; but little
side-lights, a kind of casemented window, reveal a character at
once affectionate, beautiful, and strong.</p>
<p>We have seen that their home was the region of self-denial,
and her husband long remembered, and used to tell, how &ldquo;if
there happened to be on our table one thing better than the
other, she would, modestly, but cheerfully and earnestly, resist
all importunity to partake of it until she ascertained that there
was enough for both.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a little candle such a
sentence as this is, but what a light it sheds over the whole
room!&nbsp; She did not pretend to be her husband; he filled his
larger sphere, and she, in all her manifold, gentle ways, sought
to give him rest.&nbsp; Surely she adds another name to the long
catalogue of good wives.&nbsp; She reminds us of Lavater&rsquo;s
wife, and some little incidents in that Cildwrn cottage call up
memories from the manse of St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, and the
shadows of the old Lindenhof of Zurich, where probably life did
not put on a gayer apparel, or present more lavish and luxurious
possibilities, than in the poor parsonage of Anglesea.</p>
<p>It is incredible, almost, to read what the good Catherine did,
poor&mdash;to our thinking, miserable&mdash;as was the income of
her husband.&nbsp; Her hand was most generous; how she did it,
what committee of ways and means she called together, in her
thoughtful mind, we do not know,&mdash;only, that she,
constantly, found some food to give to poor children, and needy
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>people;
unblessed by children of her own, she employed her fingers in
making clothes for the poor members, and families, of the
Church.&nbsp; There was always help for the poor hungry labourer
passing her cottage; the house was always open for the itinerant
minister travelling on his way to some &ldquo;publication,&rdquo;
and she was always ready to minister to his necessities with her
own kind hands.&nbsp; Her husband often thought that the glance
she gave upon a text shed light upon it.&nbsp; She never had
robust health, but she accompanied her husband on several of his
longer journeys through the greater part of Wales,&mdash;ah, and
some of them in the winter, through storms of rain, and snow, and
hail, along dangerous roads too, across difficult ferries; and
she was uniformly cheerful!&nbsp; What an invaluable creature,
what a blessed companion!&nbsp; A keener observer of character,
probably, from what we can gather, than her husband; a sharper
eye, in general, to detect the subterfuges of selfishness and
conceit.</p>
<p>One mighty trial she had before she died; she had, in some
way, been deeply wounded, grievously injured, and hurt, and she
found it hard to forgive; she agonized, and prayed, and
struggled; and before she was called to eternity, she was able to
feel that she had forgiven, and buried the memory of the injuries
in the love and compassion of the Redeemer.&nbsp; Her husband had
to give her up, and at a time, perhaps, when he needed her
most.&nbsp; The illness was long, but great strength was given to
her, and at last the release came.&nbsp; There was mourning in
the Cildwrn cottage.&nbsp; The last night of her life she
repeated a beautiful, and comfortable Welsh hymn, and then, <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>ejaculating
three times, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me!&rdquo; she
breathed forth her quiet, affectionate, and hopeful spirit, into
her Saviour&rsquo;s hands, and left her husband all alone, to
bear the burden of her departure, and other griefs, and troubles
which were crowding upon him.</p>
<p>Other troubles,&mdash;for, in what way we need not attempt too
curiously to inquire,&mdash;the pastorate gave to the poor old
pastor little, or no peace.&nbsp; There were strong Diotrephesian
troubles agitating the great preacher&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The
Churches, too, which Christmas Evans had raised, and to which, by
his earnest eloquence, and active, organizing mind, he had given
existence, grew restive, and self-willed beneath his guidance,
refusing his advice with reference to ministers he suggested, and
inviting others, whose appointment he thought unwise.</p>
<p>Poor Christmas!&nbsp; Did he ever ask himself, in these
moments, when he thought of his lost Catherine, and felt the
waves of trouble rising up, and beating all round him,&mdash;did
he ever ask himself whether the game was worth the candle?
whether he was a mere plaything in life, whom that arch old
player, Death, had outplayed, and defeated?&nbsp; Did it ever
seem to him that it was all a vanity, ending in vexation of
spirit?&nbsp; The life most beloved had burnt out, the building
he had spent long years to erect, seemed only to be furnished for
discomfort, and distraction.</p>
<p>Did he begin to think that the wine of life was only turning
into acrid vinegar, by-and-by to end with the long
sleeping-draught?&nbsp; Of life&rsquo;s good things, in the
worldling&rsquo;s sense of good, he had tasted few; most clearly
he had never desired them.&nbsp; He <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>had never the opportunity, nor had
he ever desired to be like a Nebuchadnezzar, roaming the world
like a beast, and pasturing at a dinner-table, as upon a sort of
meadow-land of the stomach, sinking the soul to the cattle of the
field; but he might have expected that his Church, and Churches,
would be a joy, a rest, a pleasant meadow-land to him.&nbsp; The
body was certainly crumbling to decay: would the ideas also prove
like frescoes, which could be washed out by tears, or removed,
and leave the soul only a desolate habitation, waiting for its
doom of dust?</p>
<p>We do not suppose that, amidst his depressing griefs, these
desolating beliefs, or unbeliefs, had any mastery over him.&nbsp;
What did the men who tormented him know of those mighty springs
of comfort, which came from those covenants he had made with God,
amidst the lonely solitudes of his journeyings among the wild
Welsh hills?&nbsp; He had not built his home, or his hopes, on
the faithfulness of men, or the vitality of Churches; the roots
of his faith, as they had struck downward, were now to bear fruit
upward.</p>
<p>There was a fine healthfulness in his spirit.&nbsp; There is
nothing in his life to lead one to think that he had ever been
much intoxicated by the fame which had attended him; he appears
to have been always beneath the control of the great truths in
which he believed, and it was not the seductive charms of
popularity for which he cared, but the power of those truths to
bring light, conviction, and rest, to human souls.&nbsp; All his
sermons look that way; all that we know of his preaching, and
experience, turns in that direction.</p>
<p>Rose-leaves are said to act as an emetic, and have <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>much the
same effect on the constitution as senna-leaves.&nbsp; It is so
with those sweet things which fame offers to the imagination; the
conserves of its fragrance, by-and-by, become sickening.&nbsp;
So, the robust nature of our fine old friend had to rise over
grief, and disappointment, and unfriendliness, and diaconal
dictation and impertinence.&nbsp; Only one thing he
remembered.&nbsp; He appears to have been sustained, even as
Edward Irving was, in his conviction that the truth of his
message, the lamp of the ministry which he carried, gave to him a
right, and a prerogative which he was not to relinquish; he had
proved himself, he had proved the Spirit of God to be in him of a
truth.&nbsp; He was not a wrangler, not disposed to maintain
debates as to his rights; nor was he disposed to yield to
caprice, faction, and turbulence; and so, he began to think of
retiring, old as he was, from the field, the fragrance of which
had proclaimed that the Lord had blessed him there.</p>
<p>Christmas Evans, as he draws near to the close of his work in
Anglesea, only illustrates what many a far greater, and many a
lesser man than he, have alike illustrated.&nbsp; There is a fine
word among the many fine words of that great, although eccentric
teacher, John Ruskin:&mdash;&ldquo;It is one of the appointed
conditions of the labour of man, that in proportion to the time
between the seed-sowing and the harvest, is the fulness of the
fruit; and that generally, therefore, the further off we place
our aim, and the less we desire to be the witnesses of what we
have laboured for, the more wide and rich will be the measure of
our success.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, no doubt, the consolation of
Christmas; but as we look upon him, a friendly <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>voice
reminds us, that, as he leaves Anglesea, he realizes very much of
Robert Browning&rsquo;s soliloquy of the martyred
patriot:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus I entered, and thus I go!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In triumphs people have dropped down dead.<br />
Paid by the world,&mdash;what dost thou owe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; God might question; now, instead,<br />
&rsquo;Tis God shall repay!&nbsp; I am safer so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the candlestick was removed out of its place in Anglesea,
and Anglesea soon, but too late, regretted the removal.&nbsp;
Christmas Evans, however, seems to illustrate a truth, which may
be announced almost as a general law, from the time of the
Saviour and his Apostles down to our own, that those who have
wrought most unselfishly, and serviceably for the cause of God,
and the well-being of man, had to receive their payment in
themselves, and in the life to come.&nbsp; In proportion to the
greatness of their work was the smallness of their remuneration
here.</p>
<p>If we refer to the painful circumstances in connection with
the close of the ministry of Christmas Evans at Anglesea, it is,
especially, to notice how his faith survived the shock of
surrounding trouble.&nbsp; He himself writes: &ldquo;Nothing
could preserve me in cheerfulness and confidence under these
afflictions, but the assurance of the faithfulness of Christ; I
felt assured that I had much work yet to do, and that my ministry
would be instrumental in bringing many sinners to God.&nbsp; This
arose from my trust in God, and in the spirit of prayer that
possessed me; I frequently arose above all my sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he writes: &ldquo;As soon as I went into <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the pulpit
during this period, I forgot my troubles, and found my mountain
strong; I was blessed with such heavenly unction, and longed so
intensely for the salvation of men, and I felt the truth like a
hammer in power, and the doctrine distilling like the honey-comb,
and like unto the rarest wine, that I became most anxious that
the ministers of the county should unite with me to plead the
promise, &lsquo;If any two of you agree touching anything,&rsquo;
etc.&nbsp; Everything now conspired to induce my departure from
the island: the unyielding spirit of those who had oppressed, and
traduced me; and my own most courageous state of mind, fully
believing that there was yet more work for me to do in the
harvest of the Son of Man, my earnest prayers for Divine
guidance, during one whole year, and the visions of my head at
night, in my bed&mdash;all worked together towards this
result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few things we know of are more sad than this story.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was an affecting sight,&rdquo; says Mr. William Morgan,
quoted by Mr. Rhys Stephen in his Memoir, &ldquo;to see the aged
man, who had laboured so long, and with such happy effects,
leaving the sphere of his exertions under these circumstances;
having laboured so much to pay for their meeting-houses, having
performed so many journeys to South Wales for their benefit,
having served them so diligently in the island, and passed
through so many dangers; now some of the people withheld their
contributions, to avenge themselves on their own father in the
Gospel; others, while professing to be friends, did little more;
while he, like David, was obliged to leave his city, not knowing
whether he should ever return <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>to see the ark of God, and his
tabernacle in Anglesea again.&nbsp; Whatever misunderstanding
there was between Mr. Evans, and some of his brethren, it is
clear that his counsels ought to have been received with due
acknowledgment of his age, and experience, and that his
reputation should have been energetically vindicated.&nbsp; I am
of opinion, I am quite convinced, that more strenuous exertions
should have been made to defend his character, and to bear him,
in the arms of love, through the archers, and not to have
permitted him to fall in the street without an
advocate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole aim of Mr. Evans&rsquo;s life, as far as we have
been able to read it, was to get good from heaven, in order that
he might do good on earth.&nbsp; Clearly, he never worked with
any hope of a great earthly reward for any personal worthiness;
perhaps there arose a sense that he had always been unjustly
remunerated, that burdens had been laid upon him he ought not to
have been called upon to bear; and now the sense of injustice
sought, as is so frequently the case, to vindicate itself by
ingratitude.&nbsp; It seems so perpetually true, in the sad
record of the story of human nature, that it is those who have
injured us who seek yet further to hurt us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> pause here for a short time, in
our review of the career, and character, and pulpit power of
Christmas Evans, to notice some of those eminent men, who
exercised, in his day, an influence over the Welsh mind.&nbsp; We
will then notice some of those preachers, of even the wilder
Wales, who preceded these men.&nbsp; So little is known of many
of them in England, and yet their character, and labours, are so
essentially and excellently instructive, that we feel this work,
to those who are interested, to be not one of
supererogation.&nbsp; The men, their country, the people among
whom they moved, their work in it, the singular faith in, and
love for preaching, for the <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>words these men had to
utter,&mdash;they must seem, to us, remarkable, and
memorable.&nbsp; In this time of ours, when preaching, and all
faith in preaching, is so rapidly dying out, that it may be
regarded, now, as one of the chief qualifications of a candidate
for the pulpit, that he cannot preach a sermon, but can &ldquo;go
to those who sell, and buy for himself&rdquo;&mdash;this study of
what was effected by a living voice, with a real live soul behind
it, must seem, as a matter of mere history, noteworthy.&nbsp; And
first among those who charmed the Welsh ear, in the time of
Christmas Evans, we mention Williams of Wern.</p>
<p>It is not without reason, that many eminent Welshmen can only
be known, and really designated after the place of their birth,
or the chief scene of their labours.&nbsp; The family of the
Williamses, for instance, in Wales, is a very large
one&mdash;even the eminent Williamses; and William Williams would
not make the matter any clearer; for, always with tenderest love
ought to be pronounced the name of that other William Williams,
or, as he is called, Williams of Pantycelyn&mdash;the obscure,
but not forgotten, Watts of Wales.&nbsp; His hymns have been sung
over the face of the whole earth, and long before missionary
societies had been dreamed of, he wrote, in his remote Welsh
village,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er the gloomy hills of
darkness;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and he has cheered, and comforted many a Zion&rsquo;s pilgrim
by his sweet song,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was born in 1717, and died in 1791.&nbsp; This <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>sweet and
sacred singer ought to receive more than this passing
allusion.&nbsp; Little is known of him in England; and it is
curious that Mr. Christopher&rsquo;s volume on &ldquo;Hymn
Writers and their Hymns&rdquo; neither mentions his hymns, nor
his name.</p>
<p>A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, evidently not very
favourable to that denomination of religious sentiment which
Williams represented, has spoken of the &ldquo;unmixed
pleasure&rdquo; his name and character awakens: &ldquo;He was a
man in whom singular purity of sentiment added grace to a truly
original genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His direction to other
composers was, never to attempt to compose a hymn until they feel
their souls near heaven.&nbsp; His precept, and his practice, in
this respect, have been compared to those of Fra
Angelico.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would that some competent Welsh pen would
render for us, into English, more of these notes of the sweet
singer of Pantycelyn.</p>
<p>William Williams came from the neighbourhood of Llandovery,
the parish of Pritchard of the &ldquo;Welshman&rsquo;s
Candle;&rdquo; he was, as his hymns would indicate, well
educated; he studied for, and entered upon the medical
profession; but, converted beneath the preaching of Howell
Harris, in Talgarth churchyard, he turned from medicine to the
work of the ministry.&nbsp; He was a member of the Established
Church; he sought, and received ordination, and deacon&rsquo;s
orders, but, upon application for priest&rsquo;s orders, he was
refused.&nbsp; He then united himself with the Calvinistic
Methodists, but still continued to labour with the great Daniel
Rowlands, at Llangeitho.&nbsp; His sermons were, like his hymns,
often sublime, always abounding in notes of sweetness.&nbsp;
During the forty <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>three years of his ministry, it is said, he travelled
about 2,230 miles a year, making in all 95,890 miles!&nbsp; He
wrote extensively, also, in prose.&nbsp; There is a handsome
edition of his works in the Welsh language, and an English
edition of some of his hymns.&nbsp; Among the most beautiful, our
readers will remember&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus, lead us with Thy power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe into the promised rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was William Williams of Pantycelyn.</p>
<p>Then, there was Peter Williams, a famous name in the
Principality, and of about the same period as Williams of
Pantycelyn.&nbsp; No man of his time did so much to cultivate
religious literature in Wales.&nbsp; He was a great preacher, and
an exemplary man; when a minister within the Church of England,
he was persecuted for his opinions, and practices; and, when he
left that communion, he suffered even a more bitter persecution
from his Methodist brethren.&nbsp; His life, and his preaching,
appear to have been full of romantic incidents.</p>
<p>Then there was Evan Williams, who is spoken of as a seraphic
man, and whose life appears to justify the distinctive
designation, although he died at the age of twenty-nine, very
greatly in consequence of ill-usage received in persecution.</p>
<p>Then, in England, we are better acquainted with Daniel
Williams, the founder of what is called Dr. Williams&rsquo;s
Library; and who, in addition to this magnificent bequest, left
sums of money to Wales for schools, endowments of ministers,
annual grants of Bibles, and religious books, and for widows of
ministers; by which Wales has received since, and <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>receives
now, the sum of about &pound;700 a year.&nbsp; His ministry,
however, was in London, at Hand Alley, Bishopsgate Street, nearly
two hundred years since.&nbsp; His works are contained in six
octavo volumes; but he scarcely falls beneath the intention of
these pages.</p>
<p>Besides these, there are many others; so that, as we said
above, the name of Williams represents, not only a large family,
but a family remarkable for Christian usefulness in Wales.&nbsp;
But, in this catalogue of eminent preachers, Williams of Wern,
among those of his name, is singularly eminent.&nbsp; He had that
power, to which we have referred, of using his language in such a
manner, that people, in a very awful way, realized the scenes he
described.&nbsp; Dr. Rees mentions of him, that when preaching on
the resurrection of the dead, from the window of Ynysgan Chapel,
Merthyr Tydvil, he so riveted the attention of the vast
multitude, who were on the burying-ground before him, that when
he reached the climax, all the crowd moved together in terror,
imagining that the graves under their feet were bursting open,
and the dead rising.&nbsp; Yet Williams was a singularly quiet
preacher; these effects were wrought by the power of that
language, so wonderfully fitted to work on the emotions of a very
imaginative people, and which he knew how to play upon so
well.</p>
<p>This great preacher had quite as remarkable an individuality
as either of the eminent men, whose characters we may attempt
faintly to portray.&nbsp; Christmas Evans, we have seen, led his
hearers along through really dramatic, and pictorial
representations.&nbsp; Davies was called the &ldquo;Silver
Trumpet&rdquo; of Wales; his voice was an instrument of
overwhelming compass, <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>and sweetness.&nbsp; Elias was a man
of severe, and passionate eloquence,&mdash;all the more terrible,
because held in the restraint of a perfect, and commanding
will.&nbsp; Williams differed from all three; nor must it, for a
moment, be said that he &ldquo;attained not to the first
three.&rdquo;&nbsp; His eminence was equal to theirs, and, in his
own walk, he was quite as highly esteemed; but his department of
power was completely different.&nbsp; Perhaps, he was less the
vehicle of vehement passion than either Elias, or Davies; and it
was altogether apart from his purpose to use the amazing imagery
of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; His mind was built up of compacted
thought; his images were not personifications, but
analogies.&nbsp; So far as we are able to form a conception of
him, his mind appears to have moved in a pathway of
self-evidencing light.</p>
<p>Thus, if we were to speak of these four men as constituting a
quartette in the harmony of the great Welsh pulpit, we should
give to John Elias the place of the deep bass; to Davies, the
rich and melting soprano; to Christmas Evans the tenor;
reserving, for Williams of Wern, the place of the alto.&nbsp; His
teaching was eminently self-evolved.&nbsp; None of the great
Welsh preachers dealt much with pen, and paper.&nbsp; They
wrought out their sermons on horseback, or whilst moving from
place to place.&nbsp; With Williams it was especially so.&nbsp;
Two ministers called upon him in 1830.&nbsp; One of them was
something of a bookworm, and he asked him if he had read a
certain book which had just been published.&nbsp; Williams said
he had not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; continued his friend,
&ldquo;seen so-and-so?&rdquo; naming another work.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, I have not.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, presently, a third was
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>mentioned, and the answer was still in the
negative.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; said Mr.
Williams, &ldquo;you read too much; you do not think
sufficiently.&nbsp; My plan in preparing sermons is to examine
the connection of a passage, extract its principle, and think it
over in my own mind.&nbsp; I never look at a Commentary, except
when completely beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has often been said that, in the very proportion in which
eloquence is effective, and commanding in delivery, in the degree
in which it is effective as <i>heard</i>, it is impossible to be
<i>read</i>; and, with some measure of exception, this is, no
doubt, true.&nbsp; Williams, certainly, is an illustration of
this general principle; yet he was, perhaps, one of the most
luminous of speakers; only, this alone, without accompanying
passion, does not make the orator.&nbsp; Take the following as an
illustration of his manner.&nbsp; On ejaculatory
prayer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ejaculatory prayer is the Christian&rsquo;s
breath; the secret path to his hiding-place; his express to
heaven in circumstances of difficulty, and peril; it is the tuner
of all his religious feelings; it is his sling, and stone, with
which he slays the enemy, ere he is aware of it; it is the hiding
of his strength; and, of every religious performance, it is the
most convenient.&nbsp; Ejaculatory prayer is like the rope of a
belfry; the bell is in one room, and the handle, or the end of
the rope which sets it a-ringing, in another.&nbsp; Perhaps the
bell may not be heard in the apartment where the rope is, but it
is heard in its own apartment.&nbsp; Moses laid hold of the rope,
and pulled it hard, on the shore of the Red Sea; and though no
one heard, or knew anything of it, in the lower <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>chamber,
the bell rang loudly in the upper one, till the whole place was
moved, and the Lord said, &lsquo;Wherefore criest thou unto
me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is luminous preaching.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as with
others, we have very little&mdash;scarcely anything,
indeed&mdash;left of Williams&rsquo;s pulpit talk.</p>
<p>William Williams was born in the year 1781, at
Cwm-y-swn-ganol, in Merionethshire.&nbsp; There his parents
occupied a farm, and were much respected.&nbsp; It seems, to us,
an odd thing that their name was not Williams, but Probert, or
Ap-Robert.&nbsp; He received his name of Williams from the
singular practice, then prevalent in many parts of Wales, of
converting, with the aid of the letter S, the Christian name of
the father into the surname of the son.&nbsp; His father,
although an orderly attendant upon Divine Worship, never made a
public profession of religion; but his mother was a very pious,
and exemplary member of the Calvinistic Methodist connexion.</p>
<p>The decisive hour of real religious conviction came to the
youth when he was very young&mdash;only about thirteen years of
age.&nbsp; Impressions deep, and permanent, were made on his
mind, and heart, and at fifteen he was received into Church
fellowship; but he suffered greatly from diffidence.&nbsp;
Although it was expected of him, he could not pray either in the
family, or in public, because, as he used to say, he would then
be required, by all his acquaintance, to conduct himself like a
perfect saint.&nbsp; But one night, when all the family, with the
exception of his mother, and himself, had retired to rest, she
engaged in prayer with him, and then said, &ldquo;Now, <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Will, dear,
do you pray,&rdquo; and he did so; and from this moment dated the
commencement of his courage, and confidence.</p>
<p>It was in his twenty-second year that he entered Wrexham
Academy.&nbsp; He was a thorough Welshman&mdash;a monoglot.&nbsp;
He made some progress in the acquisition of English, and Greek;
but he could never speak English fluently, and was advanced in
life before he knew a word of it; and he used to say, &ldquo;When
I violate English, I am like a child that breaks a window; I do
not go back to mend it, but I run away, hoping I shall not be
seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; As linguists, most of his fellow-students
outshone him; in the pulpit, from his very first efforts, he not
only outshone them all, but it was soon seen that he was to
transcend most of the teachers, and speakers of his time.</p>
<p>Perhaps his example will not commend itself to some of our
modern writers, as to preparation for the ministry; for when he
was recommended to continue longer under tuition, he said,
&ldquo;No&mdash;no; for if so, the harvest will be over while I
am sharpening my sickle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young as he was, he took a
singular view of the leadings of Providence, which, however,
eminently marks the character of the man.&nbsp; He received a
most unanimous invitation from a large, and influential Church at
Horeb, in Cardiganshire, and was just about accepting the
invitation, when the smaller, and, in comparison, quite
insignificant sphere of Wern was put before him, with such
commendations of the importance of the work as commanded his
regards.&nbsp; He declined Horeb, and accepted Wern.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>His
field of labour appears to have comprehended a cluster of
villages, such as Llangollen, Rhuabon, and Rhosllanerchrugog; and
in this region the greater number of his days were passed,
excepting that brief period, towards the close of his life, when
he became the minister of the great Welsh tabernacle in Cross
Hall Street, Liverpool.&nbsp; But he left Wales with a heavy
heart, amidst the pretty distinctly expressed dissatisfaction of
the people of the Principality, who, however, still insisted on
giving him his designation of Williams of Wern.&nbsp; Nor was he
away from them long.&nbsp; His old Church continued unsettled,
and after three years&rsquo; ministry in Liverpool, he returned
to Wern, to close his active, and useful life.</p>
<p>His pastorate consisted, really, of three places&mdash;Wern,
Rhos, and Harwood.&nbsp; It was a singular circumstance, that
whilst large crowds thronged round him at the first two places,
and while his name was becoming as a sharp arrow through the
whole Principality, he made little impression on Harwood.&nbsp;
He used to say that Harwood had been of greater service to him
than he had been to it; for it was &ldquo;the thorn in the flesh,
lest he should be exalted above measure;&rdquo; and if he ever
felt disposed to be lifted up when he saw the crowds gathering
round him at other places, he had only to go over to, or think
about Harwood, and this became an effectual check to the feelings
of self-inflation, in which he might have been tempted to
indulge.&nbsp; It was so, whilst other places, Churches, and
congregations, &ldquo;waited for him as for the rain, and opened
their mouths wide as for the latter rain;&rdquo; <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>whilst upon
other fields his &ldquo;doctrine distilled as the dew,&rdquo; his
stubborn Harwood appears to have been a kind of Welsh Gilboa,
upon which no dew fell.</p>
<p>He was claimed as a kind of public property, and Churches at a
distance seemed to think they had a right to his services,
frequently very much to the irritation of his own people, to whom
he might have given the consolation he once administered to a
brother minister; &ldquo;I understand that your people complain a
good deal because you so often leave them.&nbsp; Well, let us be
thankful that the reverse is not the case; for our own people
might have tired of us, and be pleased to hear strangers, and
preferred our absence, regarding us as &lsquo;a vessel wherein is
no pleasure.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately, in such cases,
congregations do not take the matter as philosophically as the
old Scotchwoman, who, when she met a neighbouring clergyman one
Sabbath morning, wending his way to her own kirk, expressed her
surprise at meeting him there, and then.&nbsp; He explained that
it was an exchange of services.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh, then,&rdquo;
said the old woman, &ldquo;<i>your</i> people will be having a
grand treat the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of the nature of Williams&rsquo;s mind, and his
method of ministration, may be gathered from his exceeding
admiration of Jacob Abbot, and especially his work, &ldquo;The
Corner Stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! what a pity,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that we cannot preach as this man
writes.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, so far as we have been able to judge
from the scanty means we possess, he did preach very much after
the manner of Jacob Abbot&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp; His words
appear, first, to have been full of strong, seminal principles,
and these were soon made <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>clear in the light of very apt
illustrations.&nbsp; Truly it has been said, that, first, the
harper seizes his harp, and lays his hand firmly upon it, before
he sweeps the strings.&nbsp; In an eminent manner, Williams gave
to his people the sense, as soon as he commenced, that a subject
was upon his heart, and mind; and he had a firm grasp of it, and
from his creative mind each successive stroke was some fine, apt,
happy evolution.</p>
<p>Illustration was his <i>forte</i>, but of a very different
order from that of Christmas Evans; for instance, illustrating
the contests of Christian creeds, and sects with each other,
&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;talking with a marine,
who gave to me a good deal of his history.&nbsp; He told me the
most terrible engagement he had ever been in, was one between the
ship to which he belonged, and another English vessel, when, on
meeting in the night, they mistook each other for a French
man-of-war.&nbsp; Many persons were wounded, some slain; both
vessels sustained serious damage from the firing, and, when the
day broke, great was their surprise to find the English flag
hoisted from the masts of both vessels, and that, through
mistake, they had been fighting all night against their own
countrymen.&nbsp; It was of no avail, now, that they wept
together: the mischief was done.&nbsp; Christians,&rdquo; said
the preacher, &ldquo;often commit the same error in this present
world.&nbsp; One denomination mistakes another for an enemy; it
is night, and they cannot see to recognise each other.&nbsp; What
will be their surprise when they see each other in the light of
another world! when they meet in heaven, after having shot at
each other through the mists of the present <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>state!&nbsp; How will they salute each other, when
better known, and understood, after having wounded one another in
the night!&nbsp; But they should wait till the dawn breaks, at
any rate, that they may not be in danger, through any mistake, of
shooting at their friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Welsh language is, as we suppose our readers well know,
especially rich in compact, proverbial, axiomatic
expressions.&nbsp; The Welsh triads are an illustration of
this.&nbsp; The same power often appears in the pulpit.&nbsp; The
latter, and more recent, languages are unfavourable to the
expression of proverbs.&nbsp; Williams we should suppose to have
been one of the most favourable exemplifications of this
power.&nbsp; General tradition in Wales gives him this kind of
eminence&mdash;poem, and proverb united in his sentences.&nbsp;
We have not been able to obtain many instances of this; and we
fear it must be admitted, that our language only in a clumsy way
translates the pithy quaintness of the Welsh, such as the
following: &ldquo;The door of heaven shuts from below, not from
above.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your iniquities have separated, saith the
Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all the birds,&rdquo; he once
said, &ldquo;the dove is the most easily alarmed, and put to
flight, at hearing a shot fired.&nbsp; Remember,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;that the Holy Ghost is compared to a dove; and
if you begin to shoot at each other, the heavenly Dove will take
wing, and instantly leave you.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit is one of
love, and peace, not of tumult, and confusion.&nbsp; He cannot
live amongst the smoke, and noise of fired shots: if you would
grieve the Holy Spirit, and compel Him to retire, you have only
to commence firing at one another, and He will instantly <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>depart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The mind of man is like a
mill, which will grind whatever you put into it, whether it be
husk or wheat.&nbsp; The devil is very eager to have his turn at
this mill, and to employ it for grinding the husk of vain
thoughts.&nbsp; Keep the wheat of the Word in the mind;
&lsquo;keep thy heart with all diligence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of his words seem very odd, although he was a most grave,
and serious man.&nbsp; Thus; &ldquo;Our prayers often resemble
the mischievous tricks of town-children, who knock at their
neighbours&rsquo; houses, and then run away; we often knock at
Heaven&rsquo;s door, and then run off into the spirit of the
world: instead of waiting for entrance, and answer, we act as if
we were afraid of having our prayers answered.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again: &ldquo;There are three devils which injure, and ravage our
Churches, and congregations,&mdash;the singing devil, the
pew-letting devil, and the Church officers&rsquo; appointment
devil: they are of the worst kind of devils, and this kind goeth
not out but by prayer, and fasting.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The old
ministers,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;were not much better
preachers than we are, and, in many respects, they were inferior
to us; but they had a success attendant upon their ministry that
can now seldom be seen.&nbsp; They prayed more than we do.&nbsp;
It was on his knees that Jacob became a prince; and if we would
become princes, we must be more upon our knees.&nbsp; We should
be successful as our fathers, could we be brought to the same
spirit, and frame of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Williams is like Elias in this; we have had none of his
sermons rendered into English, and, therefore, the descriptions
we have are rather tantalizing.&nbsp; <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Mr. Parry, the Congregational
minister of Llandudno, a man well fitted to judge&mdash;himself
one of the most distinguished living poets in the Welsh language,
and who has carried many prizes from the Eisteddfodd&mdash;says
of him: &ldquo;I shall never forget his eloquence.&nbsp; It
poured forth like a swollen torrent.&nbsp; I cannot help
referring to a sermon he preached at an annual Association at
Llanerchmedd, Anglesea.&nbsp; The meeting was, as usual, held in
the open air.&nbsp; The weather was very sultry; the congregation
seemed drowsy.&nbsp; His manner, before preaching, showed
considerable restlessness, and when he came to the desk, he
looked rather wild.&nbsp; It was evident his spirit was on fire,
and his mind charged brimful with ideas.&nbsp; He read his text
in a quick, bold tone; &lsquo;But now they desire a better
country, that is, a heavenly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He poured forth such a
flood of eloquent description, that he completely enchanted our
feelings, and made us imagine we felt the field move under our
feet.&nbsp; He himself thought this occasion one of the most
remarkable in his life; for I spoke to him about the sermon years
after.&nbsp; I believe it served to raise our Churches throughout
the whole land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a more extensive reader than any of his brethren in the
ministry; a keen observer, too, in the departments of natural
history, and natural philosophy.&nbsp; It was, indeed, much like
his own method, and it illustrated the reason of his great
admiration for Jacob Abbot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corner Stone,&rdquo;
when he very prettily says, &ldquo;The blessed Redeemer was very
fond of His Father&rsquo;s works.&rdquo;&nbsp; He used to say,
&ldquo;If we understood nature better, <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>it would
help us to understand the Bible better.&nbsp; The kingdom of
nature, and the kingdom of grace, are very like each other.&nbsp;
There is a striking resemblance between the natural principles of
the one, and the moral principles of the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
entered with a kind of joy into the sublime moods of nature; was
fond of watching the play of the lightning, and listening to the
voice of the thunder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; he used to say,
&ldquo;loved to look at the lily, and to listen to the birds; to
speak upon the mysteries of the seed, and to draw forth
principles from these things.&nbsp; It was no part of His plan to
expound the laws of nature, although He understood them more
perfectly than any one else; but He employed nature as a book of
reference, to explain the great principles of the plan of
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clergyman writes of him, that &ldquo;his appearance when
preaching was very remarkable, and singularly beautiful.&nbsp;
When standing in a great crowd, every soul seemed agitated to its
centre, and cheeks streaming with tears.&nbsp; It is but justice
that every one should have his likeness taken when he appears to
the greatest advantage; and so Williams.&nbsp; His picture, on
such an occasion, would be an honour to the country which reared
him, a treasure to the thousands who heard him, and a name to the
painter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The likeness is before us now, and in the
firm, composed thoughtfulness, a kind of sad, far outlook in the
eyes, and the lips which seem to wait to tremble into
emotion&mdash;we think we can well realize, from the inanimate
engraving, what life must have been in the speech of this
extraordinary man.&nbsp; His mind was cast in a sweetly
meditative mould.&nbsp; He was <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>fond of retreating by himself among
the trees, and walking beneath their shadows, as they formed a
canopy over his head.&nbsp; He said of one such place, &ldquo;I
think I must love that spot through all eternity, for I have felt
a degree of heaven there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus he died.&nbsp; He had lost his wife some time
before.&nbsp; It is very affecting to read the account of
himself, and his daughter, dying together in different rooms of
the same house.&nbsp; As he said to her, one day, &ldquo;We
appear to be running, with contending footsteps, to be first at
the goal.&rdquo;&nbsp; They spent much time in talking together,
with unruffled composure, of death, and heaven, and being
&ldquo;absent from the body, and present with the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every morning, as soon as he was up, found him
by the bedside of his daughter.</p>
<p>Once he said to her, &ldquo;Well, Eliza, how are you this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very weak, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are both on the
racecourse.&nbsp; Which of us do you think will get to the end
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall, father.&nbsp; I think you must have more
work to do yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I think my work is nearly
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so, father; but, still, I think I shall be
the first to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is best it should be
so, for I am more able to bear the blow.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;do you long to see the end of the
journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, from my heart!&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;Because I shall see so many of my old friends,
and my mother; and, above all, I shall see Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell them I am
coming! tell them I am coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She died first.&nbsp; Her last words were, &ldquo;Peace!
peace!&rdquo;&nbsp; He followed her shortly after&mdash;on the
17th of March, 1840, in the fifty-ninth year of his age.</p>
<p>Amongst the great preachers of Wales, not one seems to have
won more upon the tender love of those who knew him.&nbsp; Dr.
Raffles said of him, &ldquo;What he was as a preacher, I can only
gather from the effects he produced on those who understood the
language in which he spoke, but I can truly say, that every
occasion on which I saw him only served to impress me more with
the ardour of his piety, and the kindness of his heart.&nbsp; He
was one of the loveliest characters it has been my lot to
meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High strains of thought, rendered into the sweet variety,
melting tenderness, and the grand strength of the language of
Wales, seem to have been the characteristics of the preaching of
Williams of Wern; tender, and terrible, sweetness alternating
with strength.&nbsp; We have already said how much Welsh
preaching derived, in its greatest men, from the power of varying
accent; the reader may conceive it himself if ever listening to
that wonderful chorus in Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo;
which Herder, the great German, called truly the Christian Epos;
but the chorus to which we refer, is that singular piece of
varying pictorial power, &ldquo;Unto us a Child is born,&rdquo;
repeated, again and again, in sweet whispered accents, playing
upon the thought; <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>the shepherds having kept watch over their flocks by
night in the fields, and having heard the revelation voices of
the angels say it&mdash;&ldquo;For unto us a Child is
born;&rdquo; and then rolls in the grand thunder, &ldquo;And His
name shall be called Wonderful;&rdquo; and then, you return back
to the sweet silvery accents, &ldquo;For unto us a Child is
born;&rdquo; and the thought is, that the Wise Men are there
offering their gifts; and then roll in, again, the grand,
overwhelming words, &ldquo;And His name shall be called
Wonderful;&rdquo; and yet again that for which we waited, the
tender, silvery whisperings, &ldquo;Unto us a Child is
born;&rdquo; until it seems as if flocks, and herds, and fields,
shepherds, and wise men, all united with the family of Jesus,
beneath the song-singing through the heavens in the clear starry
night, &ldquo;Unto us a Child is born, and His name shall be
called Wonderful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who have listened to this
chorus, may form some idea of the way in which a great Welsh
preacher&mdash;and Williams of Wern as a special
illustration&mdash;would run his thought, and its corresponding
expression, up and down, through various tones of feeling, and
with every one awaken, on some varying accent, a fresh
interpretation, and expression.&nbsp; Perhaps, the nearest
approach we have heard, in England, to the peculiar gifts of this
preacher, has been in the happiest moods of the beloved, and
greatly honoured Thomas Jones, once minister of Bedford Chapel,
London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already implied that Welsh
preaching has had many varieties, and very various influences
too.&nbsp; Even the very excitements produced by these famous
men, whose names we are recording, varied considerably; but one
characteristic certainly seemed to attend them&mdash;the
influence was real, and very undoubted.&nbsp; When Rowland Hill
was in Wales, and witnessed some of the strong agitations
resulting from great sermons, he said, he &ldquo;liked the fire,
but he did not like the smoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, like so many
of the sayings of the excellent old humorist, prettily, and
wittily said.&nbsp; But it may, also, be remarked, that it is,
usually, impossible to have real fire without smoke; and it has
further been well said, that the stories of the results of such
preaching make <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>us feel that, could we only get the fire, we need not
object to a little of the smoke.</p>
<p>We are introducing to our readers, now, in John Elias, one
who, certainly, does not seem to have surrounded the clear flames
of his eloquence with unnatural excitement.&nbsp; If the effects
of his oratory seem to rival all that we have heard of the
astonishing power of George Whitefield, the material of his
sermons, the severity of their tone of thought, and the
fearfulness of their remorseless logic, remind us of Jonathan
Edwards.&nbsp; He had read extensively, especially in theology;
and, it has been truly said, his mind was a storehouse, large,
lofty, and rich.&nbsp; Like his great coadjutors, he prepared for
the pulpit with amazing care, and patience, but apparently never
verbally&mdash;only seeing his ideas clearly, and revolving them
over and over until, like fuel in the furnace, they flamed.&nbsp;
He tells us how, having done his part, by earnest, and patient
study, he trusted to God to give to his prepared mind its fitting
expression, and speech.&nbsp; Of course, like the rest, he
disclaimed all paper in the pulpit.&nbsp; An eminent brother
minister, Thomas Jones, of Denbigh, was coming to London to
preach what was considered the great annual sermon of the London
Missionary Society, at Surrey Chapel.&nbsp; In his own country,
Mr. Jones preached always extempore; but, being in company with
Matthew Wilkes, and John Elias, he inquired of old Matthew
whether, for such an occasion, he did not think that he had
better write his sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for <i>such</i> an occasion,&rdquo; said Matthew,
&ldquo;perhaps it would be better to write your discourse; but,
at any rate, let us have plenty of fire in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said John Elias, &ldquo;he cannot
carry fire in paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Matthew; &ldquo;paper will do
very well to light the fire with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkes&rsquo; witty rejoinder seems to give the entire
value to notes, and writing in the pulpit; but, no doubt, Elias
expressed his conviction, and the conviction of all these men,
that you cannot carry fire in paper.&nbsp; But we have before
said that it was by no means wild-fire.&nbsp; One of the great
poets of Wales imagined a conversation going on between the soul
and the body of Elias, before they both went up together in the
pulpit, when the soul said to the body, &ldquo;Now, you must be a
sacrifice for an hour.&nbsp; You must bear all my fire, and
endure all my exertion, however intense it may be.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And another writer says of him that, while some preachers remind
us of Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots, that drove heavily, Elias
reminded us, rather, of that text, &ldquo;He maketh His angels
spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever is to be said of the peculiarities of other great
Welsh preachers, it seems to be admitted, on all hands, that John
Elias was the Demosthenes of the group.&nbsp; Let no reader
smile, however high his regard for the classic orator.&nbsp; The
stories told of the effects of the preaching of John Elias,
greatly resemble those of the great Grecian orator, who, at the
close of his tremendous orations, found the people utterly
oblivious to all the beauty, and strength of his
discourses&mdash;utterly indisposed to admire, or criticise, but
only conducted to that point of vehement indignation, and
passionate action, which had been, all <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>along, the
purpose of the speaker, exclaiming, &ldquo;Let us march against
Philip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If profound passionate conviction, persuasion altogether
insensible of anything besides its own emotions, be the chief
attribute of the gifted orator, John Elias must stand, we will
not say matchless, but, from all that we have heard of him,
unsurpassed.&nbsp; We have no means of testing this by any
published sermons; scraps and fragments we have, and traditions
of the man, and his soul-piercing eloquence, float about over
Wales; but we apprehend it was an order of eloquence which would
not submit itself to either penmanship, or paper, either to the
reporter, or the printing-press.</p>
<p>How extravagant some things seem when quietly read,
unaccompanied by the passion, and excitement which the preacher
has either apprehended, or produced!&nbsp; The reader remembers
very well&mdash;for who does not?&mdash;Whitefield&rsquo;s
vehement apostrophe, &ldquo;Stop, Gabriel!&rdquo;&nbsp; Who could
deliberately write it down to utter it? and what an affectation
of emotion it seems to read it!&nbsp; But that was not the effect
produced on David Hume, who heard it; and we may be very sure
that man,&mdash;the most acute, profound, cold philosopher, and
correct writer, had no friendly feelings either to Whitefield, or
Gabriel&mdash;to the message which the preacher had to give, or
the archangel to carry.&nbsp; A quiet, ordinary, domestic state
of feeling scarcely knows how to make allowances for an inflamed
orator, his whole nature heaving beneath the passion produced by
some great, and subduing vision, an audience in his hands, as a
river of water, prepared to move whithersoever he will.&nbsp;
Thus Elias, when <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>he was handling some weighty subject, would suddenly
say, &ldquo;Stop! silence!&rdquo; (<i>Disymwth</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Gosteg</i>!)&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they saying in Heaven on
the subject?&rdquo;&nbsp; His hearers testify that, in such
moments, he almost brought them within the precincts of the
glory.&nbsp; The effect was thrilling.&nbsp; And, dealing with
alarming truths, he would exclaim, &ldquo;Stop! silence!&nbsp;
What do they say in hell on this subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who can do these things must be no hearsay man, or
such questionable excursions of speech would be likely to provoke
laughter, and contempt, rather than overwhelming awe.&nbsp; The
effect of this preacher was unutterable.&nbsp; It is said that
upon such occasions, had the people heard these things from the
invisible world, as he expatiated on the things most likely to be
uttered, either in Heaven or hell, upon the subject, they could
scarcely have been more alarmed.</p>
<p>His biographer, Mr. Morgan, Vicar of Syston, in
Leicestershire, tells how he heard him preaching once to a crowd
in the open air, on &ldquo;the Last Day,&rdquo; representing the
wicked as &ldquo;tares gathered into bundles,&rdquo; and cast
into the everlasting burnings.&nbsp; There was a certain
flax-dresser, who, in a daring and audacious way, chose to go on
with his work in an open room opposite to where Elias was
preaching from the platform; but, as the preacher grew more and
more earnest, and the flames more flashing, the terrible fire
more and more intense in its vehemence, the man was obliged to
leave his work, and run into a yard behind his house, to get out
of the reach of the cruel flames, and the awful peals of the
thunder of the preacher&rsquo;s subduing voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
the awful <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>language of that Elias followed me there also,&rdquo;
said the panic-stricken sinner.</p>
<p>There was a preacher of Caernarvon, one Richardson, a preacher
of peculiar tenderness, and sweetness, who made his hearers weep
beneath the lovely message he generally carried.&nbsp; On one
occasion, while Elias was pouring forth his vehement, and
dreadful words, painting the next world in very living, and
fearful colours, his audience all panic-stricken, and carried
along as if they were on the confines of the darkness, and the
gates opening to receive them, a man, in the agony of his
excitement, cried out, &ldquo;Oh, I wish I could hear Mr.
Richardson, of Caernarvon, just for five minutes!&rdquo;&nbsp; No
anecdote could better illustrate the peculiar gifts, and powers
of both men.</p>
<p>John Elias was a native of Caernarvonshire.&nbsp; His parents
were people in very humble circumstances, but greatly
respected.&nbsp; His paternal grandfather lived with them.&nbsp;
He was a member of the Church of England.&nbsp; His influence
over the mind of Elias appears to have been especially good; and
it is, perhaps, owing to this influence that, although he became
a minister, and the eminent pride of the Calvinistic Methodist
body, he, throughout his life, retained a strong affection for
the services, and even the institution, of the Church of
England.&nbsp; Through his grandfather, he acquired, what was not
usual in that day, the rudiments of education very early, and as
a young child, could read very well and impressively.&nbsp; Thus,
when quite a child, they went together to hear some well-known
Methodist preacher.&nbsp; The time for the service had long
passed, and the preacher did not arrive.&nbsp; The old gentleman
became impatient, <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>and said to his little grandson, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
pity the people should be idling like this; go up into the
pulpit, John, and read a chapter to them;&rdquo; and, suiting the
action to the word, he pushed the child up into the pulpit, and
shut the door after him.&nbsp; With much diffidence, he began to
read portions of the Sermon on the Mount, until, venturing to
withdraw his eye from the Bible, and look aside, lo! to his great
dismay, there was the preacher quietly waiting outside the pulpit
door.&nbsp; He gently closed the book, and slipped down the
pulpit stairs.&nbsp; This was his first appearance in the
pulpit.&nbsp; Little could any one dream that, in after years, he
was to be so eminent a master in it.</p>
<p>But he was only twenty years of age when he began to preach,
indeed; and it is said that, from the first, people saw that a
prophet of God had risen amongst them.&nbsp; There was a popular
preacher, with a very Welsh name, David Cadwalladr, who went to
hear him; and, after the sermon, he said, &ldquo;God help that
lad to speak the truth, for he&rsquo;ll make the people
believe,&mdash;he&rsquo;ll make the people believe whatever he
says!&rdquo;&nbsp; From the first, John Elias appears to have
been singularly like his two namesakes, John the Baptist, and
Elias the prophet.&nbsp; He had in him a very tender nature; but
he was a severe man, and he had a very severe theology.&nbsp; He
believed that sin held, in itself, very tremendous, and fearful
consequences, and he dealt with sin, and sinners, in a very
daring, and even dreadful manner.</p>
<p>He appeared in a rough time, when there were, in the
neighbourhood, rough, cruel, and revolting customs.&nbsp; Thus,
on Whitsunday in each year, a great concourse <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>of people
used to assemble together to burn the ravens&rsquo; nests.&nbsp;
These birds bred in a high and precipitous rock, called <i>Y
gadair</i> (that is, &ldquo;the chair&rdquo;).&nbsp; The birds
were supposed to prey on young poultry, etc., and the people
thought it necessary to destroy them; but they always did so on
the Sabbath, and it became quite a wild festival occasion; and
the manner of their destruction was most savage, and
revolting.&nbsp; The nests were beyond their reach; but they
suspended a fiery fagot by a chain.&nbsp; This was let down to
set the nests on fire; and the young birds were roasted
alive.&nbsp; At every blaze which was seen below, triumphant
shouts rose from the brutal crowd, rending the air.&nbsp; When
the savages had put the birds to death, they usually turned on
each other; and the day&rsquo;s amusement closed in fights,
wounds, bruises, and broken bones.&nbsp; One of the first of
Elias&rsquo;s achievements was the daring feat of invading this
savage assembly, by proclaiming, in their very midst, the wrath
of God against unrighteousness, and Sabbath-breaking.&nbsp;
Perhaps, to us, the idea of preaching in such a scene seems like
the attempting to still a storm by the waving of a feather; but
we may also feel that here was a scene in which that terrible
eloquence, which was a chief power of Elias, was well
bestowed.&nbsp; Certainly, it appears chiefly due to Elias that
the hideous custom was put down, and put to an end for ever.</p>
<p>It was no recreative play, no rippling out of mild,
meditative, innocent young sermons, these first efforts of young
Elias.&nbsp; For instance, there was a great fair which was wont
to be held at Rhuddlan, in Denbighshire.&nbsp; It was always held
on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Thither, into the midst of the fair,
went the young man.&nbsp; He took his stand on the steps of the
New Inn, the noise and business of the fair going on all around
him.&nbsp; His friends had earnestly tried to dissuade, and
entreated him not to venture into the midst of so wild, and
dangerous a scene.&nbsp; Farmers were there, to hire labourers;
crowds of rough labourers were there.&nbsp; It was the great
market-day for scythes, and reaping-hooks.&nbsp; In the booths
all round him were the sounds of harps, and fiddles; it was a
wild scene of dissipation.&nbsp; There stood the solemn young
man, thoughtful, grave, and compassionate.&nbsp; Of course, he
commenced with a very solemn prayer; praying so that almost every
order of person on the ground felt himself arrested, and brought,
in a solemn way, before God.&nbsp; Singular effects, it is said,
seemed to follow the prayer itself.&nbsp; Then he took for his
text the fourth commandment; but he said he had come to open upon
them &ldquo;the whole ten cannon of Sinai.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
effects could hardly have been more tremendous had the
congregation really stood at the foot of the mountain that
&ldquo;might not be touched.&rdquo;&nbsp; In any case, Elias was
an awful preacher; and we may be sure that upon this occasion he
did not keep his terrors in reserve.</p>
<p>One man, who had just purchased a sickle, was so alarmed at
the tremendous denunciations against Sabbath-breakers, that he
imagined that the arm which held the sickle was paralysed; he let
it fall on the ground.&nbsp; He could not take his eye from the
preacher; and he feared to stoop to pick it up with the other
hand, lest that should be paralysed also.&nbsp; It ought, also,
to be said this man became an entirely <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>changed
character, and lived, to an advanced age, a consistent
Christian.&nbsp; The great crowd was panic-stricken.&nbsp; The
fair was never after held on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; Some
person said to Elias, afterwards, that the fair was an old
custom, and it would recover itself, notwithstanding his
extraordinary sermon.&nbsp; Elias, in his dreadful manner,
replied, &ldquo;If any one will give the least encouragement to
the revival of that fair, he will be accursed before the Holy
Trinity, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost!&rdquo;&nbsp; A dreadfully earnest sort of man this.&nbsp;
We are not vindicating his speeches, only giving an account of
them.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, the Rector of Nevern, one of the most eminent of
the Welsh bards, says, &ldquo;For one to throw his arms about, is
not action; to make this, or that gesture, is not action.&nbsp;
Action is seen in the eye, in the curling of the lip, in the
frowning of the nose&mdash;in every muscle of the
speaker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mentioning these remarks to Dr. Pugh, when
speaking of Elias, he said he &ldquo;never saw an orator that
could be compared to him.&nbsp; Every muscle was in action, and
every movement that he made was not only graceful, but it
spoke.&nbsp; As an orator,&rdquo; said Dr. Pugh, &ldquo;I
considered him fully equal to Demosthenes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was tremendous preaching.&nbsp; It met the state of
society&mdash;the needs of the times.&nbsp; What is there in a
sermon?&mdash;what is there in preaching? some have flippantly
inquired.&nbsp; We have seen that the preaching of Elias effected
social revolutions; it destroyed bad customs, and improved
manners.&nbsp; He lived in this work; it consumed him.&nbsp;
Those who knew him, applied to him the words of Scripture:
&ldquo;The <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
estimating him, and his work, it ought never to be forgotten,
that, as has always been the case with such men, he lived in a
life of wondrous prayerfulness, and spiritual elevation.&nbsp; He
was called to preach a great Association sermon at Pwlheli.&nbsp;
In the whole neighbourhood the state of religion was very low,
and distressingly discouraging to pious minds; and it had been so
for many years.&nbsp; Elias felt that his visit must be an
occasion with him.&nbsp; It may almost be said of that day, that
&ldquo;Elias prayed, and the heavens gave rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
went.&nbsp; He took his text, &ldquo;Let God arise, and let His
enemies be scattered!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an astonishing
time.&nbsp; While the preacher drove along with his tremendous
power, multitudes of the people fell to the ground.&nbsp; Calm
stood the man, his words rushing from him like flames of
fire.&nbsp; There were added to the Churches of that immediate
neighbourhood, Mr. Elias&rsquo;s clerical biographer tells us, in
consequence of the powerful impetus of that sermon, two thousand
five hundred members.</p>
<p>The good man lived in an atmosphere of prayer.&nbsp; The
stories which gather about such men, sometimes seem to partake of
the nature of exaggerations; but, on the other hand, it ought to
be recollected that all anecdotes and popular impressions arise
from some well-known characteristic to which they are the
correspondents.&nbsp; There was a poor woman, a neighbour&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; She was very ill, and her case pressed very much upon
the mind of Elias in family prayer.&nbsp; But one morning he said
to his wife, &ldquo;I have somehow missed Elizabeth in my prayer
this morning; I think she cannot be alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words
had <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>scarcely passed from his lips when the husband was at
the door, to tell him of his wife&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>There is a singular circumstance mentioned of some
horse-races, a great disturbance to the best interests of the
neighbourhood; on the day of the great race, Elias&rsquo;s spirit
was very much moved, and he prayed most passionately and
earnestly that the Lord would do something to put a stop to
them.&nbsp; His prayer was so remarkable, that someone said,
&ldquo;Ahab must prepare his chariot, and get away.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The sky became so dark shortly after, that the gas was lighted in
some of the shops of the town.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock the
rain began to pour in torrents, and continued until five
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the next day.&nbsp; The
multitudes on the race-ground dispersed in half-an-hour, and did
not reassemble that year; and what seemed more remarkable was,
that the rainfall was confined to that vicinity.&nbsp; It is our
duty to mention these things.&nbsp; An adequate impression could
not be conveyed of the place this man held in popular estimation
without them.&nbsp; And his eminence as a preacher was
astonishing; wherever he went, whatever day of the week, or
whatever hour of the day, no matter what the time or the season,
business was laid aside, shops were closed, and the crowds
gathered to hear him.&nbsp; Sometimes, when it was arranged for
him to preach in a chapel, and more convenient that he should do
so, a window was taken out, and there he stood, preaching to the
crowded place within, and, at the same time, to the multitudes
gathered outside.&nbsp; Mr. Morgan, late vicar of Christ Church,
in Bradford, gives an account of one of these sermons.&nbsp;
There was a great panorama <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>exhibiting at the same time.&nbsp;
Elias took the idea of moving succession&mdash;the panorama of
all the miracles wrought by Christ.&nbsp; It is easy to see how,
from such lips, a succession of wonderful pictures would pass
before the eye, of living miracles of Divine working,&mdash;a
panorama of wonderful cures.&nbsp; Mr. Morgan says, &ldquo;I was
very ill at the time, but that striking sermon animated me, and I
have often stirred the cold English with the account of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have said that no sermons are preserved; Elias himself
regretted, in his advanced life, that some, which had been of a
peculiar interest to him, had gone from him.&nbsp; Fragments
there are, but they are from the lips of hearers.&nbsp; Many of
these fragments still present, in a very impressive manner, his
rousing, and piercing, and singularly original style; his
peculiar mode of dealing at will, for his purposes of
illustration, with the things of earth, heaven, and hell.</p>
<p>Take one illustration, from the text, &ldquo;<i>Shall the prey
be taken from the mighty</i>, <i>or the lawful captive be
delivered</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Satan</i>!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;what do you say?&nbsp; Shall the prey be taken
from the mighty?&nbsp; &lsquo;No, never.&nbsp; I will increase
the darkness of their minds; I will harden more the hardness of
their hearts; I will make more powerful the lusts in their souls;
I will increase the strength of their chains; I will bind them
hand and foot, and make my chains stronger; the captives shall
never be delivered.&nbsp; Ministers!&nbsp; I despise
ministers!&nbsp; Puny efforts theirs!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Gabriel</i>!&rsquo; exclaimed the preacher,
&lsquo;messenger of the Most High God: shall the prey be taken
from the mighty?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I do not
know.&nbsp; I have been <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>hovering over this assembly.&nbsp;
They have been hearing the Word of God.&nbsp; I did expect to see
some chains broken, some prisoners set free; but the opportunity
is nearly over; the multitudes are just upon the point of
separating; there are no signs of any being converted.&nbsp; I go
back from this to the heavenly world, but I have no messages to
carry to make joy in the presence of the
angels.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; There were crowds of preachers
present.&nbsp; Elias turned to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;What
think you?&nbsp; You are <i>ministers</i> of the living
God.&nbsp; Shall the prey be taken from the mighty?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah! who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm
of the Lord revealed?&nbsp; We have laboured in vain, and spent
our strength for nought; and it seems the Lord&rsquo;s arm is not
stretched out.&nbsp; Oh, there seems very little hope of the
captives being delivered!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Zion</i>!&nbsp;
Church of Christ! answer me, Shall the prey be taken from the
mighty?&nbsp; What do you say?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Zion said,
&lsquo;My God hath forgotten me; I am left alone, and am
childless.&nbsp; And my enemies say, This is Zion, whom no man
seeketh after.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, I am afraid the prey will not be
taken from the mighty&mdash;the captive will not be
delivered.&nbsp; <i>Praying Christians</i>, what do you
think?&nbsp; &lsquo;O Lord, Thou knowest.&nbsp; High is Thy hand,
and strong is Thy right hand.&nbsp; Oh that Thou wouldst rend the
heavens, and come down!&nbsp; Let the sighing of the prisoner
come before Thee.&nbsp; According to the greatness of Thy power,
preserve Thou them that are appointed to die.&nbsp; I am nearly
wearying in praying, and yet I have a hope that the year of
jubilee is at hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, at this point,
Elias assumed another, higher, and his most serious <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>manner, as
if about to speak to the Almighty; and, in quite another tone, he
said, &ldquo;What is the mind of the Lord respecting these
captives?&nbsp; Shall the prey be taken from the
mighty?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he exclaimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;Thus saith
the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;there is no doubt about the mind
and will of the Lord&mdash;no room for doubt, and
hesitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;The ransomed of the Lord shall return,
and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their
heads.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the fragment of a sermon preached when Elias was about
thirty years of age.&nbsp; Of course it can give but a very
slender idea, but perhaps it shows something of the manner of the
master.&nbsp; His imagination was very brilliant, but more
chastened, and subdued, than that of many.&nbsp; His eloquence,
like all of the highest order, was simple, and he trusted rather
to a fitting word, than to a large furniture of speech.&nbsp; It
is said that, to his friends, every sermon appeared to be a
complete masterpiece of elocution, a nicely-compacted, and
well-fitted oration.</p>
<p>Among the great Welsh preachers, David Davies, and Williams of
Wern were, like Rowlands of Llangeitho, comparatively
fixtures.&nbsp; Of course, they appeared on great Association
occasions.&nbsp; But John Elias, and Christmas Evans itinerated
far, and wide.&nbsp; Unlike as they were in the build of their
minds, and the character of their eloquence, they had a great,
and mutual, regard, and affection for each other; and it is told
how, when either preached, the other was <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>seen with
anxious interest drinking in, with the crowd, the words of his
famous brother.&nbsp; Theirs are, no doubt, the two darling names
most known to the religious national heart of Wales.&nbsp; To
John Elias it is impossible to render such a mede of justice, or
to give of his powers even so comprehensive a picture, as is
attempted, even in this volume, of Christmas Evans.</p>
<p>Something like an illustration of the man may be gathered from
an anecdote of the formation of one of the first Bible Societies
in North Wales.&nbsp; It was a very great occasion.&nbsp; A noble
Earl, the Lord Lieutenant of the county, was to take the chair;
but when he heard that John Elias was expected to be the
principal speaker, he very earnestly implored that he might be
kept back, as &ldquo;a ranter, a Methodist, and a Dissenter, who
could do no good to the meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; The position of
Elias was such that, upon such an occasion, no one could have
dared to do that; so the noble Lord introduced him, but with
certain hints that &ldquo;brevity, and seriousness would be
desirable.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of recommending seriousness to
John Elias, certainly, seems a very needless commendation; but
when Elias spoke,&mdash;partly in English, and partly in
Welsh,&mdash;especially when, in stirring Welsh, he referred to
the constitution of England, and the repose of the country, as
illustrating the value of the Bible to society, and some other
such remarks,&mdash;of course with all the orator&rsquo;s
piercing grandeur of expression,&mdash;the chairman, seeing the
inflamed state of the people, and himself not well knowing what
was said, would have the words translated to him.&nbsp; He was so
carried away by the dignified bearing of the great orator, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>that he
would have a special introduction to him at the close of the
meeting.&nbsp; A day or two after, a special messenger came to
invite him to visit, and spend some time at the house of the
Earl.&nbsp; This, however, was respectfully declined, for
reasons, no doubt, satisfactory to Elias, and which would satisfy
the peer also, that the preacher had no desire to use his great
popularity for his own personal influence, and
aggrandisement.</p>
<p>After a life of eminent usefulness, he died, in 1841, at the
age of sixty-eight.&nbsp; His funeral was a mighty procession, of
about ten thousand persons.&nbsp; They had to travel, a distance
of some miles, to the beautiful little churchyard of Llanfaes, a
secluded, and peaceful spot,&mdash;a scene of natural romance,
and beauty, the site of an old Franciscan monastery, about
fourteen miles from Llangefni, the village where Elias
died.&nbsp; The day of the funeral was, throughout the whole
district, as still as a Sabbath.&nbsp; As it passed by Beaumaris,
the procession saw the flags of the vessels in the port lowered
half-mast high; and as they passed through Beaumaris town, and
Bangor city, all the shops were closed, and all the blinds drawn
before the windows.&nbsp; Every kind of denomination, including
the Church of England, joined in marks of respect, and justified,
more distinctly than could always be done, the propriety of the
text of the funeral oration: &ldquo;Know ye not that a prince and
a great man has fallen?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of him it might truly be
said, &ldquo;<i>Behold I will make thee a new sharp threshing
instrument</i>, <i>having teeth</i>: <i>thou shalt thresh the
mountains</i>, <i>and beat them small</i>, <i>and shalt make the
hills like chaff</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall, in the next chapter,
mention several names of men, mightily influential as Welsh
preachers in their own country, and to most English readers
utterly unknown.&nbsp; Perhaps the most conspicuous of these
lesser known men is, however, David Davies, of Swansea.&nbsp; Dr.
Thomas Rees, in every sense a thoroughly competent authority,
speaks of him as one of the most powerful pulpit orators in his
own, or any other, age; and he quotes the words of a well-known
Welsh writer, a minister, who says of David Davies: &ldquo;In his
best days, he was one of the chief of the great Welsh
preachers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This writer continues: &ldquo;I may be
deemed too partial to my own denomination in making such an
observation.&nbsp; What, it may be <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>asked, shall be thought of John
Elias, Christmas Evans, and others?&nbsp; In point of flowing
eloquence, Davies was superior to every one of them, although,
with regard to his matter, and the energy, and deep feeling with
which he treated his subjects, Elias, in his best days, excelled
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to this question of feeling, however, the
writer of these pages was talking, some time since, with Dr. Rees
himself, about this same David Davies, when the Doctor said:
&ldquo;What the old people tell you about him is wonderful.&nbsp;
It was in his voice&mdash;he could not help himself; without any
effort, five minutes after he began to speak, the whole
congregation would be bathed in tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This great, and admirable man was born in the obscure little
village of Llangeler, in Carmarthenshire, in June, 1763.&nbsp;
His parents, although respectable, not being in affluent
circumstances, could give him very few advantages of
education.&nbsp; Thus it happened that, eminent as he became as a
preacher, as one of the most effective hymn-writers in his
language, and as a Biblical commentator, he was entirely a
self-made man.&nbsp; However, as is so often the case in such
instances, his earnest eagerness in the acquisition of knowledge
was manifest when he was yet very young; and he was under the
influence of very strong religious impressions at a very early
age.</p>
<p>Even when he was quite a child, he would always stand up, and
gravely ask a blessing on his meals; and it is said that there
was something so impressive, and grave, in the manner of the
child, that some careless frequenters of the house always took
off their hats, and behaved with grave decorum until the short
prayer was ended.&nbsp; His parents were not <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>religious
persons, and, therefore, it is yet more remarkable that one day,
while he was still in his earliest years, his father heard him
fervently in prayer for them behind a hedge.&nbsp; It is not
wonderful to learn that he was greatly affected by it.&nbsp; It
does not seem that this depth of religious life accompanied him
all the way through his boyhood, and his youth; but a very early
marriage&mdash;in most instances, so grave, and fatal a
mistake&mdash;would appear to have been the occasion of the
restoration of his religious convictions.&nbsp; He was but twenty
when he married Jane Evans, a respectable, and lovely young woman
of his own neighbourhood; and now his religious life began in
real earnest.</p>
<p>It is surely very remarkable, as we have already seen, that
he, and Christmas Evans were admitted into Church fellowship on
the same evening,&mdash;the Church to which we have already
referred,&mdash;beneath the pastorate of the eminent scholar, and
bard, David Davies, of Castell Hywel.&nbsp; The singularity did
not stop here.&nbsp; Christmas Evans, and the young Davies,
preached their first sermon in the same little cottage, in the
parish of Llangeler, within a week of each other.&nbsp; The two
youths were destined to be the most eminent lights of their
different denominations, in their own country, in that age; but
neither of them continued long in connection with the Church at
Castell Hywel; and as they joined at the same time, so about the
same time they left.</p>
<p>David Davies, their pastor, was a great man, and an eminent
preacher, but he was an Arian, and the Church members were
chiefly of the same school of thought; and the convictions of
both youths were <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>altogether of too deep, and matured an order, to be
satisfied by the Arian view of the person, and work of
Christ.&nbsp; Moreover, they both, by the advice of friends, were
looking to the work of the Ministry, for which they must have
early shown their fitness; and, as we have noticed in the case of
Christmas Evans, there was a rule in the Church at Castell Hywel,
that no one should be permitted to preach who had not received an
academical training.</p>
<p>This, in addition to their dissatisfaction with services
devoted chiefly to the frigid statements of speculative points of
doctrine, or the illustration of worldly politics, soon operated
to move the young men into other fields.&nbsp; Evans, as we know,
united himself with the Baptists; Davies found a congenial
ministration at Pencadair, under the direction of a noted
evangelical teacher of those parts, the Rev. William
Perkins.&nbsp; There his deepest religious convictions became
informed, and strengthened.&nbsp; Davies was always a man of
emotion; it was his great strength when he became a preacher; and
his biographer very pleasingly states the relation of his
after-work to this moment of his life, when he says that,
&ldquo;Beneath the teaching of Mr. Perkins, a delightful change
came over his feelings; he could now see, in the revealed
testimony concerning the work finished by our Divine Surety, and
Redeemer, enough to give confidence of approach &lsquo;into the
holiest,&rsquo; to every one who believes the report of it, as
made known to all alike in the Scriptures.&nbsp; We may justly
say, &lsquo;Blessed are their eyes who see&rsquo; this; who see
that God is now &lsquo;reconciling the world unto Himself, not
imputing unto men their trespasses.&rsquo;&nbsp; They, <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>indeed, see
the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending, and
descending upon the Son of Man.&nbsp; They see that fulfilled
which was set forth of old in vision to Jacob, the restoration of
intercourse between earth and heaven through a mediator; and, in
the discovery of it, they walk joyfully in the way of peace, and
in the gracious presence of their reconciled Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after this period that the first sermon was preached,
in the cottage to which we have alluded.&nbsp; &ldquo;The humble
beginning of both Davies, and Evans, naturally reminds us,&rdquo;
says Davies&rsquo; biographer, &ldquo;of the progress of an oak
from the acorn to the full-grown tree, or that of a streamlet
issuing from an obscure valley among the mountains, and swelling,
by degrees, into a broad, and majestic river.&rdquo;&nbsp; David
Davies soon became well known in his neighbourhood as a mighty
evangelist.&nbsp; Having grounded his own convictions, and even
then possessed of a copious eloquence, it is not wonderful to
read that dead Churches rose into newness of life, and became, in
the course of time, flourishing societies.&nbsp; He was ordained
as a co-pastor with the Rev. John Lewis, at Trefach.&nbsp; The
chapel became too small, and a new one was built, which received
the name of Saron.&nbsp; He became a blessing to Neuaddlwyd, and
Gwernogle; his words ran, like flames of fire, through the whole
district.&nbsp; It is said that his active spirit, and fervent
style of preaching, gave a new tone to the ministry of the
Independents throughout the whole Principality.&nbsp; Hearers,
who have been unaccustomed to the penetrating, the quietly
passionate emotionalness of the great Welsh preachers, can
scarcely form an <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>idea of the way in which their at once happy, and
invincible words would set a congregation on fire.</p>
<p>The beloved, and revered William Rees, of Liverpool, in his
memoir of his father, gives an illustration of this, in
connection with a sermon preached by Mr. Davies; and it furnishes
a striking proof of the force of his eloquence.&nbsp; The elder
Rees speaks of one meeting in particular, which he attended at
Denbigh, at the annual gathering of the Independents.&nbsp; A
minister from South Wales preached at the service with unusual
power, and eloquence.&nbsp; Among the auditors, there was a
venerable man, named William Lewis, who possessed a voice loud,
and clear as a trumpet, and who was, at that time, a celebrated
preacher among the Calvinistic Methodists.&nbsp; The southern
minister, in full sail, with the power of the
&ldquo;<i>hwyl</i>&rdquo; strong upon him, and the whole
congregation, of course, in full sympathy, all breathless, and
waiting for the next word, came to a point in his sermon where he
repeated, says Mr. Rees, in his most pathetic tones, the verse of
a hymn, which can only be very poorly conveyed in
translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Streams from the rock, and bread from
heaven,<br />
Were, by their God, to Israel given;<br />
While Sinai&rsquo;s terrors blazed around,<br />
And thunders shook the solid ground,<br />
No harm befell His people there,<br />
Sustained with all a Father&rsquo;s care,<br />
Perversely sinful though they were.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drift of the passage was to show that the believer in
Christ is just as safe amidst terrors from within, and
without.&nbsp; The sentiment touched the electric chord in the
hearts of the multitude.&nbsp; Old <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>William Lewis could bear it no
longer.&nbsp; Up he started, unable to conceal his
feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes! oh, yes!&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;blessed be His name!&nbsp; God supported His people amidst
all the terrors of Sinai, sinful, and rebellious though they
were.&nbsp; That was the most dreadful spot in which men could
ever be placed; yet, even there, God preserved His people
unharmed.&nbsp; Oh, yes! and there He sustained me, too, a poor,
helpless sinner, once exposed to the doom of His law, and
trembling before Him!&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner had the old man
uttered these words, than a flame seemed instantaneously to
spread through the whole congregation, which broke forth into
exclamations of joy, and praise.&nbsp; But the preacher, who had
kindled this wonderful fire, and who could do such things!&nbsp;
For some time, Mr. Rees was unable to find out who it was; and it
was the younger Rees, long the venerable minister in Liverpool,
who discovered afterwards, from one of his father&rsquo;s old
companions, that it was David Davies, from the south,&mdash;he
who came to be called, in his more mature years, &ldquo;The great
Revivalist of Swansea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, after labouring until the year 1802 in the more obscure
regions we have mentioned, where, however, his congregations were
immense, and his influence great over the whole Principality, he
was invited by the Churches of Mynyddbach, and Sketty&mdash;in
fact, parts of Swansea&mdash;to become their pastor; and on this
spot his life received its consummation, and crown.</p>
<p>When Mr. Davies entered the town, it was a remarkably wicked
spot; the colliers were more like barbarians than the inhabitants
of a civilized country.&nbsp; <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Gangs of drunken ruffians prowled
through its streets, and the suburbs in different directions,
ready to assault, and ill-treat any persons who ventured near
them.&nbsp; They were accustomed to attack the houses as they
passed, throwing stones at the doors, and windows, and could
scarcely open their mouths without uttering the most horrid
oaths, and blasphemies.&nbsp; It seems almost strange, to our
apprehensions now, that the presence of a preacher should effect
a change in a neighbourhood; yet nothing is more certain, than
the fact that immense social reformations were effected by
ministers of the Gospel, both in England, and in Wales.</p>
<p>Mr. Davies had not long entered Swansea before the whole
neighbourhood underwent a speedy, and remarkable change.&nbsp; He
had a very full, and magnificent voice; a voice of amazing
compass, flexibility, and tenderness; a voice with which,
according to all accounts, he could do anything&mdash;which could
roll out a kind of musical thunder in the open air, over great
multitudes, or sink to the softest intonations, and whispers, for
small cottage congregations.&nbsp; It was well calculated to
arrest a rude multitude.&nbsp; And so it came about that
Mynyddbach became as celebrated for the work of David Davies, as
the far-famed Llangeitho for the great work, and reformation of
David Rowlands.&nbsp; The people poured in from the country round
to hear him.&nbsp; Then, although very tender, and genial, his
manner was so solemn, and he had so intense a power of realizing,
to others, the deep, and weighty truths he taught, that he became
a terror to evil-doers.</p>
<p>It is mentioned that numbers of butchers from <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the
neighbourhood of Cwmamman, and Llangenie, were in the habit of
attending Swansea market on Saturdays.&nbsp; Some of them, after
selling the meat which they had brought, were accustomed to
frequent the public-houses, and to remain there drinking, and
carousing until the Sunday morning.&nbsp; It is a well-known, and
amusing circumstance, that, in the course of a little time, when
proceeding homewards on their ponies, if they caught a glimpse of
Mr. Davies coming in an opposite direction, they hastily turned
round, and trotted off, until they could find a bystreet, or
lane, to avoid his reproving glances, or warnings, which had the
twofold advantage of pertinency and serious wit, conveyed in
tones sufficiently stentorian to reach their ears.&nbsp; And
there was a man, proverbially notorious for his profane swearing,
who plied a ferry-boat between Swansea, and Foxhole; whenever he
perceived Mr. Davies approaching, he took care to give a caution
to any who might be using improper expressions:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear, Mr. Davies is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there is another story, which shows what manner of man
this Davies was.&nbsp; One Saturday night, a band of drunken
young men, and boys, threw a quantity of stones against his door,
according to their usual mode of dealing with other houses.&nbsp;
While they were busy at their work of mischief, he suddenly
opened the door, rushed out, and secured two or three of the
culprits, who were compelled to give him the names of all their
companions.&nbsp; He then told them that he should expect every
one of them to be at his house on a day which he mentioned.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the whole party came at the appointed <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>hour, but
attended by their mothers, who were exceedingly afraid lest the
offending lads should be sent to prison in a body.&nbsp; Instead
of threatening to take them before the magistrates, Mr. Davies
told them to kneel down with him; and having offered up an
earnest prayer, and affectionately warned them of the
consequences of their evil ways, he dismissed them, requesting,
however, that they would all attend at Ebenezer Chapel on the
following Sunday.&nbsp; They were, of course, glad to comply with
his terms, and to be let off so easily.&nbsp; In after years,
several of them became members of his Church, and maintained
through life a consistent Christian profession.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
one of them,&rdquo; said Dr. Rees, when writing the story of his
great predecessor, &ldquo;is an old grey-headed disciple, still
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such anecdotes as these show how far the character of the man
aided, and sustained the mighty power of the minister.&nbsp; Our
old friend, the venerable William Davies, of Fishguard, says:
&ldquo;I well remember Mr. Davies of Swansea&rsquo;s repeated
preaching tours through Pembrokeshire, and can never forget the
emotions, and deep feelings which his matchless eloquence
produced on his crowded congregations everywhere; he had a
penetrating mind, a lively imagination, and a clear, distinctive
utterance; he had a remarkable command of his voice, with such a
flow of eloquence, and in the most melodious intonations, that
his enraptured audience would almost leap for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instances are not wanting, either in the ancient, or modern
history of the pulpit, of large audiences rising from their
seats, and standing as if all spellbound, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>while the
preacher was pursuing his theme, and, to the close of his
discourse, subdued beneath the deepening impression, and rolling
flow of words.&nbsp; Perhaps the reader, also, will remember, if
he have ever been aware of such scenes, that it is not so much
glowing splendour of expression, or the weight of original ideas,
still less vehement action, which achieves these results, as a
certain marvellous, and melodious fitness of words, even in the
representation of common things.</p>
<p>But to return to Mr. Davies.&nbsp; Davies of Fishguard,
aforementioned, gives an illustration of his preaching:
&ldquo;The captain of a vessel was a member of my Church at
Fishguard, but he always attended Ebenezer, when his vessel was
lying at Swansea.&nbsp; One day, he asked another captain,
&lsquo;Will you go with me next Sunday, to hear Mr. Davies?&nbsp;
I am sure he will make you weep.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Make
<i>me</i> weep?&rsquo; said the other, with a loud oath.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s not a preacher in this world can make
<i>me</i> weep.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, he promised to go.&nbsp;
They took their seats in the front of the gallery.&nbsp; The
irreligious captain, for awhile, stared in the preacher&rsquo;s
face, with a defiant air, as if determined to disregard what he
might say; but when the master of the assembly began to grow
warm, the rough sailor hung down his head, and before long, he
was weeping like a child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was an illustration
of the great power of this man to move, and influence the
affections.</p>
<p>As compared with other great Welsh preachers, Davies must be
spoken of as, in an eminent manner, a singer, a prophet of song,
and the swell, and cadences of his voice were like the many
voices, <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>which blend to make up one complete concert.&nbsp; He
was not only a master of the deep bass notes, but he had a rich
soprano kind of power, too; for we read that &ldquo;when he
raised his voice to a higher pitch than ordinary, it increased in
melody, and power, and its effects were thrilling in the extreme;
there were no jarring notes&mdash;all was the music of eloquence
throughout.&rdquo;&nbsp; This must not be thought
wonderful&mdash;it is natural; all men cannot be thus, nor all
preachers, however good, and great.&nbsp; There are a few noble
organs in the world.&nbsp; The organ itself, however considered,
is a wonderful instrument, but there are some built with such
extraordinary art that they are capable of producing transcendent
effects beyond most other instruments.&nbsp; Davies, the
preacher, was one of these amazing organs, in a human frame; but
the power of melody was still within his own soul, and it was the
wonderful score which he was able to read, and which he compelled
his voice to follow, which yet produced these amazing
effects.</p>
<p>Surely, it is not more wonderful, that the human voice should
have its great, and extraordinary exceptions, than that most
wonderful piece of mechanism and art, an organ.&nbsp; We have the
organs of Berne, Haarlem, and the Sistine Chapel&mdash;such are
great exceptions in those powers which art exercises over the
kingdom of sound; their building, their architecture, has made
them singular, and set them apart as great instruments.&nbsp; But
even in these, who does not remember the power of the <i>vox
humana</i> stop?&nbsp; We apprehend that few who have heard it in
the organs of Berne, or Fribourg, will sympathise with Dr.
Burney&rsquo;s irreverent, <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>and ridiculous condemnation of it,
in his &ldquo;History of Music,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;cracked
voice of an old woman of ninety, or Punch singing through a
comb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Far from this, the hearer waits with intense
anxiety, almost goes to hear this note, and realizes in it, what
has been said so truly, that music, as it murmurs through the
ear, is the nurse of the soul.&nbsp; But all organs have not the
<i>vox humana</i> stop, nor all preachers either.&nbsp; The human
voice, like the organ, is a mighty instrument, but it is the soul
which informs the instrument with this singular power, so that
within its breast all the passions seem to reign in turn.&nbsp;
Singular, that we have thought so much of the great organs of the
Continent, and have listened with such intensity to the great
singers, and have failed to apply the reflection that the
greatest preachers must be, in some measure, a combination of
both.</p>
<p>Davies was one of those preachers, without whose presence the
annual gatherings, in which the Welsh especially delighted, would
have been incomplete.&nbsp; On such occasions, he was usually the
last of the preachers&mdash;the one waited for.&nbsp; As the
service proceeded, it naturally happened that some weariness fell
over the assembly; numbers of people might be seen in different
parts, sitting, or reclining, on the grass; but as soon as David
Davies appeared on the platform, there was a gathering in of all
the people, pressing forward from all parts of the field, eager
to catch every word which fell from the lips of the
speaker.&nbsp; When a great singer appears at a concert, who of
all the audience would lose a single bar of the melody?&nbsp; He
gave out his own hymn in a voice <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>that reached, without effort, to the
utmost limits of the assembled multitude, though he spoke in a
quiet, natural tone, without any exertion.&nbsp; He read his text
deliberately, but in accents sufficiently loud to be heard with
ease by ten thousand people.&nbsp; What is any great singer,
without distinctness of enunciation?&nbsp; And distinct
enunciation has always been one of the strong points of the great
Welsh preachers.&nbsp; Hence, from this reason, he was always
impressive, and he seldom preached without using some Scriptural
story, which he made to live, through his accent, in the hearts
of the people; illustrative similes, and not too many of them;
striking thoughts, beneath the pressure of which his manner
became more and more impressive, until, at each period, his
hearers were overpoweringly affected.&nbsp; Every account of him
speaks of his wonderfully impressive voice; and all this gained
additional force from his dignified bearing, and appearance,
which took captive, and carried away, not only more refined
intelligences, but even coarsest natures, while the preacher
never approached, for a moment, the verge of vulgarity.&nbsp;
Contemporary preachers bore testimony that when the skilful
singer had closed his strain, the people could not leave the
spot, but remained for a long time after, weeping, and
praising.</p>
<p>We have said, already, that Mr. Davies was one of the Welsh
hymn-writers; eighty of his hymns are said to be among the best
in the Welsh language.&nbsp; He was a strong man, of robust
constitution, but, it may be said, he died young; before he had
reached his fiftieth year, his excessive labours had told visibly
on his health, and for many months before his death, he was <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>strongly
impressed with the idea that the time of his departure was at
hand.&nbsp; He died in the year 1816.&nbsp; The first Sabbath of
that year, he preached a very impressive sermon, from the text,
&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, This year thou shalt die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His last sermon was preached about three weeks before he died,
when he also administered the ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, and gave the right hand of fellowship to thirteen
persons, on their admission into the Church.&nbsp; He spoke only
a few words during the service, and in those, in faltering
accents, told his people he did not expect to be seen amongst
them any more.&nbsp; And, indeed, there was every indication, by
his weakness, that his words would be fulfilled.&nbsp; Every
cheek was bedewed with tears.&nbsp; The hearts of many were ready
to burst with grief; for this man&rsquo;s affections were so
great, that he produced, naturally, that grief which we feel when
the holders of our great affections seem to be parted from
us.</p>
<p>He went home from this meeting to die.&nbsp; The struggle was
not long protracted.&nbsp; On the morning of December 26th, 1816,
he breathed his last.&nbsp; On the day of the funeral, a large
concourse, from the town, and neighbourhood, followed his remains
to the grave.&nbsp; These lie in a vault, which now occupies a
space in the centre of the new chapel, reared on the site of that
in which he ministered so affectionately; and over the pulpit, a
chaste, and beautiful mural marble tablet memorialises, and very
conspicuously bears the name of David Davies.&nbsp; Of him, also,
it might be said: &ldquo;<i>The Lord God hath given me the tongue
of the learned</i>, <i>that I should know how to speak a word in
season to him that is weary</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Character.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the characteristic names of
Wales, remarkable in that department to which we shall devote
this chapter, whoever may be passed by, the name of Rees
Pritchard, the ancient Vicar of Llandovery, ought not to go
unmentioned.&nbsp; We <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>suppose no book, ever published in
Wales, has met the acceptance and circulation of
&ldquo;Canwyll-y-Cymry,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Welshman&rsquo;s
Candle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the day of its publication, it has
gone through perfectly countless editions; and there was a time,
not long since, when there was scarcely a family in Wales, of any
intelligence, which did not possess a copy.</p>
<p>Its author was born in the parish of which he became the
vicar, so far back as 1575.&nbsp; He was educated at
Oxford.&nbsp; His early life was more remarkable for dissipation
of every kind, than for any pursuits compatible with his sacred
profession.&nbsp; He was, especially, an inveterate drunkard; the
worst of his parishioners were scandalised by his example, and
said, &ldquo;Bad as we may be, we are not half so bad as the
parson!&rdquo;&nbsp; The story of his conversion is known to
many, who are not acquainted with his life, and work, and the
eminence to which he attained; and it certainly illustrates how
very strange have been some of the means of man&rsquo;s
salvation, and how foolish things have confounded the wise.&nbsp;
As George Borrow says in his &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; in his
account of Pritchard, &ldquo;God, however, who is aware of what
every man is capable, had reserved Rees Pritchard for great, and
noble things, and brought about his conversion in a very
remarkable manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in the habit of spending much of his time in the
public-house, from which he was, usually, trundled home in a
wheelbarrow, in a state of utter insensibility.&nbsp; The people
of the house had a large he-goat, which went in, and out, and
mingled with the guests.&nbsp; One day, Pritchard called the goat
to him, and offered it some ale, and the creature, so far <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>from
refusing it, drank it greedily, and soon after fell down in a
state of intoxication, and lay quivering, to the great delight of
Pritchard, and his companions, who, however, were horrified at
this conduct in one, who was appointed to be their example, and
teacher.&nbsp; Shortly after, as usual, Pritchard himself was
trundled home, utterly intoxicated.&nbsp; He was at home, and
ill, the whole of the next day; but on the day following, he went
down to the public-house, and called for his pipe, and
tankard.&nbsp; The goat came into the room, and again he held the
tankard to the creature&rsquo;s mouth; but it turned away its
head in disgust, hurried away, and would come near him no
more.&nbsp; This startled the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;is this poor dumb creature wiser than
I?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pursued, in his mind, the train of feeling
awakened by conscience; he shrank, with disgust, from
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, thank God!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
yet alive, and it is not too late to mend.&nbsp; The goat has
taught me a lesson; I will become a new man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Smashing his pipe, he left his tankard untasted, and hastened
home.&nbsp; He, indeed, commenced a new career.&nbsp; He became,
and continued for thirty years, a great, and effective preacher;
&ldquo;preaching,&rdquo; says Mr. Borrow, &ldquo;the inestimable
efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s blood-shedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those poetical pieces which he wrote at intervals, and which
are called &ldquo;The Welshman&rsquo;s Candle,&rdquo; appear only
to have been gathered into a volume, and published, after his
death.&nbsp; The room in which he lived, and wrote, appears to be
still standing; and Mr. Borrow says: &ldquo;Of all the old houses
in Llandovery, the old Vicarage is, by far, the most worthy of
attention, irrespective of the wonderful monument <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>of
God&rsquo;s providence, and grace, who once inhabited it;&rdquo;
and the old vicar&rsquo;s memory is as fresh in Llandovery,
to-day, as ever it was.&nbsp; While Mr. Borrow was looking at the
house, a respectable-looking farmer came up, and was about to
pass; &ldquo;but observing me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and how I
was employed, he stopped, and looked now at me, and now at the
antique house.&nbsp; Presently he said, &lsquo;A fine old place,
sir, is it not?&nbsp; But do you know who lived
there?&rsquo;&nbsp; Wishing to know what the man would say,
provided he thought I was ignorant as to the ancient inmate, I
turned a face of inquiry upon him, whereupon he advanced towards
me, two or three steps, and placing his face so close to mine,
that his nose nearly touched my cheek, he said, in a kind of
piercing whisper, &lsquo;<i>The Vicar</i>!&rsquo; then drawing
his face back, he looked me full in the eyes, as if to observe
the effect of his intelligence, gave me two or three nods, as if
to say, &lsquo;He did indeed,&rsquo; and departed.&nbsp;
<i>The</i> Vicar of Llandovery had then been dead nearly two
hundred years.&nbsp; Truly the man in whom piety, and genius, are
blended, is immortal upon earth!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Welshman&rsquo;s Candle&rdquo; is a set of homely, and very
rememberable verses, putting us, as far as we are able to judge,
in mind of our Thomas Tusser.</p>
<p>Mr. Borrow gives us a very pleasant taste in the following
literal, vigorous translation, which we may presume to be his
own:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;GOD&rsquo;S
BETTER THAN ALL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s better than heaven, or aught therein;<br />
Than the earth, or aught we there can win;<br />
Better than the world, or its wealth to me&mdash;<br />
God&rsquo;s better than all that is, or can be.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;Better than father, than mother, than nurse;<br
/>
Better than riches, oft proving a curse;<br />
Better than Martha, or Mary even&mdash;<br />
Better, by far, is the God of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God for thy portion thou hast ta&rsquo;en,<br />
There&rsquo;s Christ to support thee in every pain;<br />
The world to respect thee thou wilt gain;<br />
To fear thee, the fiend, and all his train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the best of portions, thou choice didst make,<br />
When thou the high God to thyself didst take;<br />
A portion, which none from thy grasp can rend,<br />
Whilst the sun, and the moon on their course shall wend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the sun grows dark, and the moon turns red;<br />
When the stars shall drop, and millions dread;<br />
When the earth shall vanish, with its pomp, in fire,<br />
Thy portion shall still remain entire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let not thy heart, though distressed, complain;<br
/>
A hold on thy portion firm maintain.<br />
Thou didst choose the best portion, again I say;<br />
Resign it not till thy dying day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the age of preachers in Wales, to which the following
pages will more immediately refer, commences with those two great
men, who were indeed the Whitfield, and the Wesley of
Wales&mdash;Howell Harris of Trevecca, and Daniel Rowlands of
Llangeitho.&nbsp; It is remarkable that these two men, born to be
such inestimable, and priceless blessings to their country, were
born within a year of each other&mdash;Harris at Trevecca, in
1714, Rowlands at Pantybeidy, in Cardiganshire, in 1713.&nbsp; As
to Harris, he is spoken of as the most successful preacher that
ever ascended a pulpit, or platform in Wales; and yet nothing is
more certain, than that he neither aimed to preach, nor will his
sermons, so far as any <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>knowledge can be obtained of them,
stand the test of any kind of criticism.&nbsp; This only is
certain, their unquestioned, and greatly pre-eminent
usefulness.</p>
<p>He did not deliver composed sermons, but unpremeditated
addresses, on sin, and its tremendous consequences; on death, and
the judgment, and the world to come.&nbsp; It is said, &ldquo;His
words fell like balls of fire, on the careless, and impenitent
multitudes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Himself destined for a clergyman of the
Church of England, an Oxford man, and with a fair promise of
success in the Church&mdash;since before he left Oxford, he had a
benefice offered him&mdash;he repeatedly applied, in vain, for
ordination.&nbsp; Throughout his life, he continued ardently
attached to the services of the Church of England.</p>
<p>It was, unhappily, from that Church, in Wales, he encountered
his most vehement opposition, and cruel persecution.&nbsp; He,
however, roused the whole country,&mdash;within the Church of
England, and without,&mdash;from its state of apathy, and
impiety; while we quite agree with his biographer, who says:
&ldquo;Any attempt to account philosophically for the remarkable
effects which everywhere attended the preaching of Howell Harris,
would be nothing better than an irreverent trifling with a solemn
subject.&nbsp; All that can be said, with propriety, is, that he
was an extraordinary instrument, raised by Providence, at an
extraordinary time, to accomplish an extraordinary
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Llangeitho, and its vicar, seem to demand a more
lengthened notice, as coming more distinctly within the region of
the palpable, and apprehensible.&nbsp; Daniel Rowlands was a
clergyman, and the son of a clergyman.&nbsp; At twenty-two years
of age, he was <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>appointed perpetual curate, or incumbent, of the united
parishes of Nantcwnlle and Llangeitho, at a salary of ten pounds
a year.&nbsp; He never received any higher preferment in the
Church on earth, although so eminent a blessing to his
country.&nbsp; He must have been some such man as our William
Grimshaw, of Haworth.&nbsp; When he entered upon his curacy, he
was quite an unconverted young man, given to occasional fits of
intoxication, and in the summer he left his pulpit, to take his
part, with his parishioners, in the sports, and games in the
neighbouring fields, or on the village green.</p>
<p>But, in the immediate neighbourhood of his own hamlet,
ministered a good and consistent Nonconformist, Philip Pugh, a
learned, lovable, and lowly man; and, in the smaller round of his
sphere, a successful preacher.&nbsp; Daniel Rowlands appears to
have been converted under a sermon of the eminent Rev. Griffith
Jones of Llanddouror, at Llanddewibrefi; but it was to Philip
Pugh that he was led for that instruction, and influence, which
instrumentally helped to develop his character.&nbsp; It would
seem that Rowlands was a man bound to be in earnest; but
conversion set on fire a new genius in the man.&nbsp; He
developed, hitherto undiscovered, great preaching power, and his
church became crowded.&nbsp; Still, for the first five years of
his new course of life, he did not know that more glorious and
beautiful Gospel which he preached through all the years
following.</p>
<p>He was a tremendous alarmist; the dangers of sin, and the
terrors of the eternal judgments, were his topics; and his
hearers shrank, and recoiled, while <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>they were fascinated to
listen.&nbsp; Again, the venerable Nonconformist stepped in;
Philip Pugh pointed out his defect.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear
sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;preach the Gospel&mdash;preach the
Gospel to the people.&nbsp; Give them the balm of Gilead; show
the blood of Christ; apply it to their spiritual wounds; show the
necessity of faith in a crucified Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am afraid,&rdquo; said Rowlands, &ldquo;that I have not all that
faith myself, in its full vigour, and exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Preach on it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pugh; &ldquo;preach on it,
until you feel it in that way,&mdash;it will come.&nbsp; If you
go on preaching in the way you have been doing, you will kill
half the people in the country.&nbsp; You thunder out the curses
of the law, and preach in such a terrific manner, that nobody can
stand before you.&nbsp; Preach the Gospel!&rdquo;&nbsp; And again
the young clergyman followed the advice of his patriarchal
friend, and unnumbered thousands in Wales had occasion, through
long following years, to bless God for it.</p>
<p>Does not the reader call up a very beautiful picture of these
two, in that old and obscure Welsh hamlet, nearly a hundred and
fifty years since?&mdash;the conversation of such an one as Paul,
the aged, with his young son, Timothy; and if anything were
needed to increase our sense of admiration of the young
clergyman, it would be that he did not disdain to receive lessons
from old age, and an old age covered with the indignities
attaching to an outlawed Nonconformist.&nbsp; In Wales, there
were very many men like Philip Pugh; we may incidentally mention
the names of several in the course of these pages&mdash;names
well worthy of the commendation in Johnson&rsquo;s perfect
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>&ldquo;Their virtues walked their narrow round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor made a pause, nor left a void;<br />
And sure the Eternal Master found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their single talent well employed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still they fill affection&rsquo;s eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind;<br />
And let not arrogance deny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its praise to merit unrefined.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there opened a great career before Rowlands, and
Llangeitho became as a shrine in evangelical Wales.&nbsp; He
received invitations to preach in every neighbourhood of the
Principality; many churches were opened to him, and where they
were not, he took freely, and cheerfully, to the chapels, or the
fields.&nbsp; His words, and accents were of that marvellous kind
we have identified with Welsh preaching.&nbsp; Later on, and in
other times, people said, he found his successor in Davies of
Swansea; and the highest honour they could give to Swansea, in
Davies&rsquo; day, was that &ldquo;it was another
Llangeitho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowlands had the power of the thunder, and the dew; he pressed
an extraordinary vitality into words, which had often been heard
before, so that once, while reading the Church Service, in his
own church, he gave such a dreadful tenderness to the words,
&ldquo;By thine agony, and bloody sweat!&rdquo; that the service
was almost stopped, and the people broke forth into a passion of
feeling.&nbsp; Christmas Evans says: &ldquo;While Rowlands was
preaching, the fashion of his countenance became altered; his
voice became as if inspired; the worldly, dead, and careless
spirit was cast out by his presence.&nbsp; The people, as it
were, drew near to the cloud, towards Christ, and Moses, <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>and
Elijah.&nbsp; Eternity, with its realities, rushed upon their
vision.&nbsp; These mighty influences were felt, more or less,
for fifty years.&nbsp; Thousands gathered at Llangeitho for
communion every month, and they came there from every county in
Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such power there is in human words when divinely wielded; such
was the spiritual power of Daniel Rowlands.&nbsp; Well does one
writer say, the story of Llangeitho, well written, would read
like a chapter in religious romance.&nbsp; It is very doubtful
whether we have the record of any other man who drew such numbers
to the immediate circle of his ministry, as Rowlands.&nbsp; He
did not itinerate so largely as most of the great Welsh
preachers.&nbsp; In an obscure spot in the interior of
Cardiganshire, in an age of bad roads, and in a neighbourhood
where the roads were especially bad, he addressed his immense
concourses of people.&nbsp; His monthly communion was sometimes
attended by as many as three thousand communicants, of whom,
often, many were clergymen.&nbsp; Upwards of a hundred ministers
ascribe to him the means of their conversion.&nbsp; Thus, in his
day, it was a place of pilgrimages; and even now, there are not a
few who turn aside, to stand, with wonder, upon the spot where
Rowlands exercised his marvellous ministry.</p>
<p>The four great Welsh preachers, Christmas Evans, John Elias,
Williams of Wern, and Davies of Swansea, on whose pulpit powers,
and method, we have more distinctly dilated, may be styled the
tetrarchs of the pulpit of Wild Wales of these later times.&nbsp;
Their eminence was single, and singular.&nbsp; Their immense
powers unquestioned: rivals, never, apparently, by <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>their own
selection, the great Welsh religious mind only rivalled them with
each other.&nbsp; After them it might be said, &ldquo;Great was
the company of preachers,&rdquo;&mdash;great, not merely in
number, carrying also influence, and usefulness of another kind;
perhaps even superior to those honoured names.</p>
<p>How, for instance, can we do sufficient honour to the labours
of <span class="smcap">Charles of Bala</span>?&nbsp; This truly
apostolic man was born at Llanvihangel, in 1755.&nbsp; While yet
a boy, he managed to introduce family worship into his
father&rsquo;s house; but it was in his eighteenth year that he
heard the great Daniel Rowlands preach, and he says: &ldquo;From
that day I found a new heaven, and a new earth, to enjoy; the
change experienced by a blind man, on receiving his sight, is not
greater than that which I felt on that day.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his
twentieth year he went to Oxford, and received Deacon&rsquo;s
orders, and was appointed to a curacy in Somersetshire; he took
his degree at his University, but he could never obtain
priest&rsquo;s orders; in every instance objection was made to
what was called his Methodism.</p>
<p>The doors of the Establishment were thus closed against him,
and he was compelled to cast in his lot with the Welsh
Methodists, in 1785.&nbsp; Before this, he had preached for
Daniel Rowlands in his far-famed church at Llangeitho, and the
great old patriarch simply uttered a prophecy about him when he
said, &ldquo;Mr. Charles is the gift of God to North
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was an eminent preacher, but it was rather
in other ways that he became illustrious, in the great religious
labours of his country.&nbsp; Moving about to preach, from place
to place, his heart became painfully impressed, and distressed,
by the <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>great ignorance of the people everywhere, and that such
multitudes were unable to read the Word of God; so he determined
on the establishment of schools upon a singular principle.</p>
<p>It was two or three years before he commenced his more settled
labours in Wales, that Robert Raikes had originated the
Sunday-school idea in Gloucester.&nbsp; Thomas Charles was the
first to seize upon the idea, and introduce it into his own
country.&nbsp; Charles had an organizing, and administrative,
mind; he fixed upon innumerable places, where he settled
schoolmasters, for periods of from six to nine, and twelve
months, to teach the people to read, giving them the initial
elements, and rudiments, of education, and then removing these
masters to another locality.</p>
<p>So he filled the country with schools&mdash;Sabbath, and
night-schools.&nbsp; He visited the schools himself,
periodically, catechizing the children publicly; and in the
course of his lifetime, he had the satisfaction of seeing the
aspect of things entirely changed.&nbsp; He used no figure of
speech, when, towards the close of his life, he said, &ldquo;The
desert blossoms as the rose, and the dry land has become streams
of water.&rdquo;&nbsp; To these purposes of his heart he was able
to devote whatever money he received from the work of the
ministry; he testifies affectionately that &ldquo;the wants of my
own family were provided for by the industry of my dear
wife;&rdquo; and he received some help by donations from
England.&nbsp; He found, everywhere, a dearth of Bibles, and it
is curious to read that, although the Church of England would not
receive him as one of her ministers, when his work became
established, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge made
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>him,
after considerable reluctance, a grant of no less than ten
thousand Welsh Bibles.&nbsp; After this, he went to London, for
the purpose of establishing a Society to supply Wales with the
Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; It was at a meeting of the Religious Tract
Society, which was called together for that purpose, that it was
resolved to establish the British and Foreign Bible Society; and
before that society had been established ten years, it had
supplied Wales with a hundred thousand copies of the Word of
God.</p>
<p>Other men were great preachers, but Thomas Charles was, in the
truest sense of the word, a bishop, an overseer,&mdash;travelling
far, and wide, preaching, catechizing, administrating, placing
and removing labourers.&nbsp; All his works, and words, his
inward, and his outward life, show the active, high-toned
saintliness, and enthusiastic holiness, of the man.&nbsp; There
is, perhaps, no other to whom Wales is so largely indebted for
the giving direction, organization, and usefulness to all
religious labour, as to him.&nbsp; His modesty transcended his
gifts, and his activity.&nbsp; John Campbell, of Kingsland,
himself noted in all the great, and good works of that time,
relates that at a meeting, at Lady Anne Erskine&rsquo;s, at which
Mr. Charles was requested to state the circumstances which had
made little Bala a kind of spiritual metropolis of the
Principality of Wales, &ldquo;he spoke for about an hour, and
never once mentioned himself, although he was the chief
instrument, and actor, in the whole movements which had made the
place so eminent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This good man, John Campbell, afterwards wrote to Mr.
Charles&rsquo;s biographer: &ldquo;I never was at Bala <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>but once,
which was not long after his removal to the regions of
immortality; and such was my veneration for his character, and
labours, that, in approaching it, I felt as if I was about coming
in sight of Sinai, or Jerusalem, or treading on classical
ground.&nbsp; The events of his life, I believe, are viewed with
more interest by the glorified than the battles of Actium, or
Waterloo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as a preacher, he was unlike those men, whose words moved
upon the wheels of thunder, and who seemed to deal with the
lightnings of imagination, and eloquence.&nbsp; As we read his
words, they seem to flow with refreshing sweetness.&nbsp; He was
waited for, and followed everywhere, but his utterances had
nothing of the startling powers we have seen; we should think he
preached, rather, to those who knew, by experience, what it is to
grow in grace.&nbsp; There is a glowing light of holiness about
his words&mdash;a deep, sweet, experimental reality.&nbsp; Of
course, being a Welshman, his thoughts were pithily
expressed.&nbsp; They were a sort of spiritual proverbs, in which
he turned over, again and again, some idea, until it became like
the triads of his country&rsquo;s literature; and dilating upon
an idea, the various aspects of it became like distinct facets,
setting forth some pleasant ray.</p>
<p>Such was Thomas Charles.&nbsp; Wales lost him at the age of
sixty&mdash;a short life, if we number it by years; a long life,
if we consider all he accomplished in it; and, to this day, his
name is one of the most revered throughout the Principality.</p>
<p>It is impossible to do the justice even of mentioning the
names of many of those men, who &ldquo;served <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>their
generation&rdquo; so well, &ldquo;according to the will of God,
and then fell asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is as necessary, as it
is interesting, to notice how the various men, moved by the
Spirit of God, found Him leading, and guiding them in the path of
labour, their instincts chose.</p>
<p>In the history of preaching, we believe there is no more
curious chapter than this, of these strange preachers in
Wales.&nbsp; They have an idiosyncrasy as entirely, and
peculiarly, their own, as is that of the country in which they
carried on their ministrations.&nbsp; The preaching friars of the
times we call the dark, or middle ages, are very remarkable, from
the occasional glimpses we are able to obtain of them.&nbsp; Very
remarkable the band of men, evoked by the rise of Methodism in
England,&mdash;those who spread out all over the land, treading
the paths indicated by the voice, and finger of Whitfield, or
Wesley.&nbsp; Very entertaining are the stories of the preachers
of the backwoods of America, the sappers, and miners, who cleared
a way for the planting of the Word among the wild forests of the
Far West.</p>
<p>These Welsh preachers were unlike any of them,&mdash;they had
a character altogether their own.&nbsp; A great many of them were
men of eminent genius, glowing with feeling, and fancy; never
having known college training, or culture, they were very often
men who had, somehow, attained a singular variety of knowledge,
lore, and learning, which, perhaps, would be despised as
unscientific, and unclassified, by the schools, but which was not
the less curious, and, to the Celtic mind, enchanting.</p>
<p>They all lived, and fared hard; all their thoughts, <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>and fancies
were high.&nbsp; If they marched before us now, the nineteenth
century would, very likely, regard them as a set of very rough
tykes.&nbsp; Perhaps the nineteenth century would regard Elijah,
Amos, and Nahum, and sundry other equally respectable persons, in
much the same manner.&nbsp; Rude, and rough in gait, and attire,
the rudeness, and the roughness would, perhaps, be forgotten by
us, if we could interpret the torrent, and the wail of their
speech, and be, for a short time, beneath the power of the
visions, of which they were the rapt seers, and unveilers.&nbsp;
We wonder that no enthusiastic Welshman has used an English pen
to pourtray the lives, and portraits of a number of these Welsh
worthies; to us, several of them&mdash;notably, John Elias, and
Christmas Evans&mdash;seem to realize the idea of the Ancient
Mariner,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I pass like night from land to land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have strange power of speech;<br />
The moment that his face I see,<br />
I know the man that must hear me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To him my tale I teach.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, how many people in England ever heard the name
of <span class="smcap">Thomas Rhys Davies</span>, an
extraordinary man?&nbsp; And he left an extraordinary diary
behind him, for he seems to have been a very methodical man; and
his diary shows that he preached during his lifetime at least
13,145 times, and this diary contains a distinct record of the
time, place, and text; and it is said that there is scarcely a
river, brook, or tarn, from Conway to Llansanan, from Llanrwst to
Newbridge, from the sea at Llandudno, to the waters of the Berwyn
mountains, in whose waves he had not baptized.</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>In
fact, he was, perhaps, in his own particular, and peculiar line,
second to none of the great Welsh preachers; only, it is said
that his power was inexplicable, and yet that it stood the
severest tests of popularity.&nbsp; His sermons are said to have
been exceedingly simple, and very rememberable; they sprang out
of a rare personal charm; he was himself; but, perhaps, if he
resembled one of his great brethren, it would be Williams of
Wern.&nbsp; His style was sharp, pointed, axiomatic, but
antithetic, never prodigal of words, his sermons were short; but
he was able to avail himself of any passing circumstance in the
congregation, and to turn it to good account.&nbsp; Once, when a
congregation seemed to be even more than usually disposed to
cough, he said, &ldquo;Cough away, my friends, it will not
disturb me in the least; it will rather help me than not, for if
you are coughing, I shall be sure that you are awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had that rare gift in the preacher, perfect
self-possession, the grand preliminary to mastery over a
congregation, an entire mastery over himself.&nbsp; All great
Welsh preachers, however they may sometimes dilate, and expand
truths into great paintings, and prolonged descriptions, excel in
the pithy, and proverb-uttering power; but Thomas Rhys Davies was
remarkable in this.&nbsp; Here are a few
illustrations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ignorance is the devil&rsquo;s
college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only three passages in the Bible which
declare what God is, although there are thousands which speak
about Him.&nbsp; God is a Spirit, God is Light, and God is
Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pharaoh fought ten great battles with God, and did not
gain one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;The way through the Red Sea was safe enough for
Israel, but not for Pharaoh; he had no business to go that way,
it was a private road, that God had opened up for His own
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the oldest believer remember that Satan is
older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is the Bishop, not of titles, but of
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moses was learned, but slow of speech; it was well that
he was so, or, perhaps, he would not have found time to write the
law.&nbsp; Aaron had the gift of speech, and it does not appear
that he had any other gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have no pleasure in your religion, make haste to
change it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judas is much blamed for betraying Christ for three
pounds; many, in our day, betray Him a hundred times for three
pence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pharaoh commanded that Moses should be drowned; in
after days, Pharaoh was paid back in his own coin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many have a brother&rsquo;s face, but Christ has a
brother&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was Thomas Rhys Davies; like Christmas Evans, journeying
from North through South Wales, he was taken ill in the same
house in which Christmas Evans died.&nbsp; Conscious of his
approaching death, he begged that he might die in the same bed;
this was not possible, but he was buried in the same grave.</p>
<p>Then there was <span class="smcap">Evan Jones</span>; he had
been a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Christmas Evans; Christmas
Evans appears to have brought him forward, giving his verdict on
his suitability as to the ministry.&nbsp; Christmas <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Evans was
able to appreciate the young man, for he seems to have possessed
really brilliant powers; in his country, and in his land&rsquo;s
language, he attained to the distinction of a bard; and it is
said that his poetry rose to an elevation of wild, and daring
grandeur.&nbsp; As a preacher, he does not appear to have studied
to be popular, or to seek to adapt his sermons to the multitude;
he probably moved through cloudy grandeurs, from whence, however,
he sometimes descended, with an odd quaintness, which, if always
surprising, was sometimes reprehensible.&nbsp; Once, he was
expatiating, glowingly, on the felicities of the heavenly state,
in that tone, and strain which most preachers love, occasionally,
to indulge, and which most hearers certainly, occasionally,
enjoy; he was giving many descriptive delineations of heavenly
blessedness, and incidentally said, &ldquo;There they neither
marry, nor are given in marriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was sitting
beneath him a fervent brother, who, probably, not knowing what he
said, sounded forth a hearty &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;&nbsp; Evan heard
it, looked the man full in the face, and said, &ldquo;Ah,
you&rsquo;ve had enough of it, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man was, perhaps, in his later years, the most intimate
friend of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; Christmas poured his brilliant
imagination, couched in his grand, although informal, rhetoric
over the multitudes; Evan Jones frequently soared into fields
whither, only here and there, an eye could follow his flight; but
when the two friends were alone, their spirits could mingle
pleasantly, for their minds were cast very much in the same
mould; and when Christmas Evans died, it was this friend who
published in <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>Welsh one of the most graceful tributes to his
memory.</p>
<p>In the history of the preaching, and preachers of a hundred
years since, we meet, of course, with many instances of men, who
possessed considerable power, but allied with much illiterate
roughness; still, the power made itself very manifest&mdash;a
power of illustrating truth, and making it clearly
apprehended.&nbsp; Such a preacher must <span
class="smcap">Shenkin of Penhydd</span> have been, rough, and
rude farmer as he was, blending, as was not at all uncommon then,
and even in our own far more recent knowledge, the occupations of
a farmer, and the ordained minister.&nbsp; Shenkin has left a
very living reputation behind him; indeed, from some of the
accounts we have read of him, we should regard him as quite a
type of the rude, yet very effective, Welsh orator.</p>
<p>Whatever the Welsh preacher had to say, however abstract, it
had to be committed to an illustration, to make it palpable, and
plain.&nbsp; In those early times, a very large room, or barn, in
which were several hundreds of people, would, perhaps, have only
one solitary candle, feebly glimmering over the gloom.&nbsp; It
was in such circumstances, or such a scene, that Shenkin was once
preaching on Christ as the Light of the world.&nbsp; In the
course of his sermon, he came to show that the world was not its
own light, and announced to his hearers what, perhaps, might
startle some of them, that &ldquo;light was not in the
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed as if he had no sooner said this,
than he felt it to be a matter that required illustration.&nbsp;
As he warmed with his subject, going round, and round to make his
meaning plain, but all the time seeming to <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>fear that
he was not doing much towards it with his rustic congregation, he
suddenly turned to the solitary candle, and blew it out, leaving
his congregation in utter darkness.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, triumphantly, to his invisible congregation,
&ldquo;what do you say to that?&nbsp; Is the light in the
eye?&rdquo;&nbsp; This, of course, settled the matter in the
minds of the most obtuse; but it was still a serious matter to
have to relight, in a lonely little chapel, an extinguished
candle.</p>
<p>He was a singular creature, this Shenkin.&nbsp; Not many Welsh
preachers have a greater variety of odd stories told than he, of
his doings, and sayings.&nbsp; He had a very downright, and
straightforward method of speech.&nbsp; Thus, he would say,
&ldquo;There are many who complain that they can scarcely
remember anything they hear.&nbsp; Have done with your
lying!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound to
say you remember well what you sold your old white horse for at
Llandaff fair three years ago.&nbsp; Six or seven pounds, was
it?&nbsp; Certainly that has not escaped your memory.&nbsp; You
can remember anything but the Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And many of
his images were much more of the rough-and-ready, than of the
classical, order.&nbsp; &ldquo;Humility,&rdquo; he once said,
&ldquo;is as beautiful an ornament as a cow&rsquo;s tail; but it
grows, like the cow&rsquo;s tail, downwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales was covered with men like this.&nbsp; Every district
possessed them, and many of them have found their memorial in
some little volume, although, in most instances, they only
survive in the breath of popular remembrance, and tradition.</p>
<p>One of the mightiest of these sons of thunder, who has left
behind him a name, and fame, scarcely <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>inferior to the great ones on whom
we have more lengthily dwelt, was <span class="smcap">Ebenezer
Morris</span>.&nbsp; He was a fine, free, cheerful spirit; his
character sparkled with every Christian virtue,&mdash;a man of
rare gifts, and grace.&nbsp; With a severe sense of what was just
in the relations of life, and what constituted the principles of
a strong theology, keeping his unblemished course beneath the
dominion of a peaceful conscience, he enjoyed, more than many,
the social fireside chat, with congenial friends.&nbsp; Although
a pastor, and a preacher of wide fame, he was also a farmer; for
he was one of an order of men, of whom it has been said, that
good people were so impressed with the privilege conferred by
preaching the gospel, that their hearers were careful not to
deprive them of the full enjoyment of it, by remunerating their
labours too abundantly.</p>
<p>Ebenezer Morris held a farm, and the farmer seems to have been
worthy of the preacher.&nbsp; A story is told of him that,
wanting to buy a cow, and going down to the fair, he found one
for sale which he thought would suit him, and he bought it at the
price named by its owner.&nbsp; Some days after, Mr. Morris found
that the price of cattle had gone up considerably, and meeting
the previous owner of the cow, he said, &ldquo;Look here, I find
you gave me too great a bargain the other day; the cow is worth
more than I purchased her for,&mdash;here is another guinea; now
I think we shall be about right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are several stories told, in the life of this good, and
great man, showing that he could not take an unfair advantage,
that he was above everything mean, unfair, and selfish, and that
guineas, and farms <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>weighed nothing with him in the balance against
righteousness, and truth.&nbsp; His influence over his whole
country was immense; so much so, that a magistrate addressed him
once in public, saying, &ldquo;We are under great obligations to
you, Mr. Morris, for keeping the country in order, and preserving
peace among the people; you are worth more than any dozen of
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; On one occasion he was subp&oelig;naed, to
attend before a court of justice, to give evidence in a disputed
case.&nbsp; As the book was handed to him, that he might take the
oath, the presiding magistrate said, &ldquo;No! no! take it away;
there is no necessity that Mr. Morris should swear at all; his
word is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His appearance in preaching, his entire presence, is described
as most majestic, and commanding: his voice was very loud, and it
is said, a word from his mouth would roll over the people like a
mighty wave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at that window,&rdquo; said an
aged deacon, in North Wales, to a minister, who had come to
preach at the chapel to which the former belonged, &ldquo;look at
that window!&nbsp; It was there that Ebenezer Morris stood, when
he preached his great sermon from the words, &lsquo;The way of
life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell
beneath,&rsquo; and when we all turned pale while we were
listening to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the
minister, &ldquo;do you remember any portion of that
sermon?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; said the old deacon;
&ldquo;remember, my good man?&nbsp; I should think I do, and
shall remember for ever.&nbsp; Why, there was no flesh here that
could stand before it!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What did he
say?&rdquo; said the minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say! my good
man,&rdquo; replied the deacon; &ldquo;say?&nbsp; <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>Why, he was
saying, &lsquo;Beneath, beneath, beneath!&nbsp; Oh, my people,
hell is beneath, beneath, <i>beneath</i>!&rsquo; until it seemed
as if the end of the world had come upon us all in the chapel,
and outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Theophilus Jones was selected as Rowland Hill&rsquo;s
co-pastor at Wooton-under-Edge, Ebenezer Morris came to preach on
his induction.&nbsp; In that place, the audience was not likely
to be a very sleepy one, but this preacher roused them beyond
their usual mark, and strange stories are told of the sermon,
while old Rowland sat behind the preacher, ejaculating the whole
of the time; and many times after, when Mr. Hill found the people
heavy, and inattentive, he was in the habit of saying, &ldquo;We
must have the fat minister from Wales here, to rouse you up
again!&rdquo;&nbsp; We know his likeness very well, and can
almost realize his grand, solemn manner, in his black velvet cap,
which made him look like a bishop, and gave much more
impressiveness to his aspect, than any mitre could have done.</p>
<p>This Ebenezer Morris was the son of a man eminent in his own
day, David Morris, of whom it was said, that he scarcely ever
preached a sermon which was not the means of the conversion of
men, and in his evangelistic tours he usually preached two, or
three times a day.&nbsp; There is a sermon, still spoken of,
preached at Rippont Bridge, Anglesea.&nbsp; The idea came to him
whilst he was preaching, that many of the people before him might
surely be lost, and he burst forth into a loud dolorous wail,
every line of his countenance in sympathy with his agonizing cry,
in Welsh, which no translation can <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>render, &ldquo;O bobl y golled fawr!
y golled fawr!&rdquo;&nbsp; The English is, &ldquo;O ye people of
the great loss! the great loss!&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems slight
enough to us, but it is said that the people not only moved
before his words, like reeds in a storm, but to this day they
speak in Anglesea of David Morris&rsquo;s sermon of &ldquo;The
Great Loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great authority for the most interesting stories of the
religious life in Wales, is the &ldquo;History of Welsh
Methodism,&rdquo; by the late Rev. John Hughes, of Liverpool;
unfortunately, we believe it only exists in Welsh, in three
volumes, amounting to nearly two thousand pages; but &ldquo;Welsh
Calvinistic Methodism; a Historical Sketch,&rdquo; by the Rev.
William Williams, appears to be principally a very entertaining
digest, and condensation, of many of the most noticeable
particulars from the larger work.&nbsp; There have certainly
appeared, from time to time, many most interesting, and faithful
men in the ministry of the Gospel in Wales, quite beyond the
possibility of distinct mention; some of them were very poor, and
lowly in life, and circumstances.&nbsp; Such was <span
class="smcap">Thomas Hughes</span>.&nbsp; He is described as a
man of small talent, and slender knowledge, but of great
holiness, and with an intense faith that many of his neighbours
were in a very bad condition, and that it was his duty to try to
speak words to them, whereby they might be saved.&nbsp; He used
to stand under the old walls of Conway, and numbers gathered
around him to listen; until at last he excited the anger of the
vicar, who caused him to be arrested, and brought into his
presence, when the following conversation took place:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ought to be a learned
man, to go about, and to be able to answer deep
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hughes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;What questions, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here they are&mdash;those which
were asked me by the Lord Bishop.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see whether
you will be able to answer them.&nbsp; Where was St. Paul
born?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hughes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Tarsus.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hem!&nbsp; I see that you know
something about it.&nbsp; Well, can you tell me who took charge
of the Virgin Mary after our blessed Redeemer was
crucified?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hughes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;John.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, once again.&nbsp; Who wrote
the Book of Revelation?&nbsp; Answer that if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hughes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;John the Apostle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho! you seem to know a good deal,
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hughes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you will allow me to
ask you one or two questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes; only they must be religious
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hughes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is holiness? and how can a
sinner be justified before God?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho! we have no business to bother
ourselves with such things, and you have no business to put such
questions to a man in my position; go out of my sight, this
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to the men who had brought him,
&ldquo;Take care that you do not bring such people into my
presence any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hughes was a simple, earnest, believing man, with a good deal
of Welsh cuteness.&nbsp; After this interview with the vicar, he
was permitted to pursue his exhortations <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>at Conway
in peace.&nbsp; But there is a place between Conway, and
Llandudno, called Towyn Ferry; it was a very ignorant little
nook, and the people were steeped in unbelief, and sin; thither
Hughes determined to go, but his person was not known
there.&nbsp; The news, however, was circulated abroad, that there
was to be a sermon, and religious service.&nbsp; When he arrived,
he found things did not appear very pleasant; there were heaps of
stones prepared for the preacher&rsquo;s reception, when he
should make his appearance, or commence his work.&nbsp; Hughes
had nothing clerical in his manner, or garb, any more than any
one in the crowd, and no one suspected him to be the man, as he
threw himself down on the grass, and entered familiarly into
conversation with the people about him.&nbsp; After a time, when
their patience began to fail, he stood up, and said, &ldquo;Well,
lads, there is no sign of any one coming; perhaps the man has
heard that you are going to stone him; let one of us get up, and
stand on that heap of stones, and talk, and the rest sing.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t that be first-rate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said a bully, who seemed to be the
recognised leader of the crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go on the heap,
and preach to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Hughes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing
to try; but mind you, I shall make some blunders, so you must be
civil, and not laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em civil,&rdquo; said the
bully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here, lads, whoever laughs, I&rsquo;ll
put one of these stones into his head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop you!&rdquo; said Hughes; &ldquo;the first thing we
have to do, is to pray, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said the bully, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll be clerk.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stand before you, and you
shall use my shoulder for the pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So prayer was offered, short, and simple, but in real earnest;
and at its close, a good many favourable words were
uttered.&nbsp; Some volunteered the remark that, &ldquo;It was
every bit as good as a parson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hughes proceeded to
give out a text, but the bully shouted,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, you fool! we&rsquo;ve got to sing
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said Hughes, &ldquo;I forgot
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sang a Welsh hymn, after a fashion, and then came the
text, and the sermon, which was short, and simple too, listened
to very attentively; and the singular part of the story is, that
the bully, and clerk, left the ground with the preacher, quieted,
and changed, and subsequently he became a converted man.&nbsp;
The regeneration of Wales, through its villages, and lone remote
districts, is full of anecdotes like this,&mdash;stories of
persecution, and the faithful earnestness of simple men, who felt
in them a strong desire to do good, and fulfilled their desire,
becoming humble, but real blessings to their neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Only in a history of the Welsh pulpit&mdash;and that would be
a volume of no slight dimensions&mdash;would it be possible to
recapitulate the names of the men who exercised, in their day,
considerable influence over the scattered thousands of the
Principality.&nbsp; They constitute a very varied race, and were
characterized by freshness, and reality, taking, of course, the
peculiar mental complexion of the preacher: some calm, and still,
but waving about their words like quiet lightnings; some
vehement, overwhelming, <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>passionate; some remarkable for
their daring excursions of imagination; some abounding in wit,
and humour.&nbsp; One of the most remarkable of these last, one
who ought not to go unmentioned in such an enumeration, was <span
class="smcap">Samuel Breeze</span>.&nbsp; This was the man who
first introduced &ldquo;The Churchyard World&rdquo; to Dr.
Raffles,&mdash;of whom it was said, that if you heard one of his
sermons, you heard three preachers, so various were not only the
methods of his sermons, but even the tone of his voice.&nbsp; He
is said to have produced extraordinary effects.&nbsp; Christmas
Evans said of him, that &ldquo;his eyes were like a flame of
fire, and his voice like a martial strain, calling men to
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer of this volume, in a work on the &ldquo;Vocation of
the Preacher,&rdquo; mentions a curious instance, which he gives
from the unpublished reminiscences of a dear departed
friend&mdash;the Rev. John Pyer, late of Devonport&mdash;who was
present when the incident happened, in Bristol, perhaps nearly
eighty years since.&nbsp; Sammy Breeze, as he was familiarly
called by the multitudes who delighted in his ministry, came,
periodically, from the mountains of Cardiganshire, or the
neighbourhood of Aberystwith, to Bristol, where he spoke with
more than tolerable efficiency in English.&nbsp; Mr. Pyer, then a
youth, was in the chapel, when, as was not unusual, two
ministers, Sammy Breeze and another, were to preach.&nbsp; The
other took the first place, a young man with some tints of
academical training, and some of the livid lights of a then only
incipient rationalism in his mind.&nbsp; He took for his text,
&ldquo;He that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>not shall
be damned;&rdquo; but he condoned the heavy condemnation, and, in
an affected manner, shaded off the darkness of the doom of
unbelief, very much in the style of the preacher in
Cowper&rsquo;s satire, who never mentioned hell to ears
polite.&nbsp; The young man, also, grew sentimental, and
&ldquo;begged pardon&rdquo; of an audience, rather more polite
than usual, for the sad statement made in the text.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he that believeth
shall be saved, and he that believeth not&mdash;indeed, I regret
to say, I beg your pardon for uttering the terrible truth, but,
indeed, he shall be sentenced to a place which here I dare not
mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then rose Sammy Breeze.&nbsp; He began: &ldquo;I shall take
the same text, to-night, which you have just heard.&nbsp; Our
young friend has been fery fine to-night, he has told you some
fery polite things.&nbsp; I am not fery fine, and I am not
polite, but I will preach a little bit of truth to you, which is
this: &lsquo;He that believeth shall be saved, and he that
believeth not shall be damned,&rsquo; <i>and I begs no
pardons</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continued, &ldquo;I do look round on
this chapel, and I do see people all fery learned and
in-tel-lect-u-al.&nbsp; You do read books, and you do study
studies, and fery likely you do think that you can mend
God&rsquo;s Book, and are fery sure you can mend me.&nbsp; You
have great&mdash;what you call thoughts, and poetries; but I will
tell you one little word, and you must not try to mend that; but
if you do, it will be all the same; it is this, look you:
&lsquo;He that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth
not shall be damned, <i>and I begs no pardons</i>.&nbsp; And then
I do look round your chapel, and I do see you are a foine people,
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>well-dressed people, well-to-do people.&nbsp; I do see
that you are fery rich, and you have got your moneys, and are
getting fery proud; but I tell you, it does not matter at all;
for I must tell you the truth, and the truth is, &lsquo;He that
believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned,&rsquo; <i>and I begs no pardons</i>.&nbsp; And
now,&rdquo; continued the preacher, &ldquo;you will say to me,
&lsquo;What do you mean by talking to us in this way?&nbsp; Who
are you, sir?&rsquo;&nbsp; And now I will tell you.&nbsp; I am
Sammy Preeze.&nbsp; I have come from the mountains of
Cardiganshire, on my Master&rsquo;s business, and His message I
must deliver.&nbsp; If you will never hear me again, I shall not
matter much, but while you shall hear me, you shall hear me, and
this is His word in me, and in me to you: &lsquo;He that
believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned,&rsquo; <i>and I begs no pardons</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange scene; but as he went on, in quaint, but
terribly earnest strain, anger passed into awe, and mute
astonishment into rapt attention.&nbsp; No one, who heard the
words, could ever again hear them unheeded, nor think lightly of
the doom of the unbelieving.&nbsp; The anecdote is worth being
laid to heart, in these days, when there is too often a reserve
in declaring the whole counsel of God.</p>
<p>After service, in the vestry, the deacons were in great anger
with the blunt preacher; and one, a well-known religious man in
Bristol, exclaimed, &ldquo;Mr. Breeze, you have strangely
forgotten yourself to-night, sir.&nbsp; We did not expect that
you would have behaved in this way.&nbsp; We have always been
very glad to see you in our pulpit, but your sermon <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>to-night,
sir, has been most insolent, shameful!&rdquo;&nbsp; He wound up a
pretty sharp condemnation by saying, &ldquo;In short, I
don&rsquo;t understand you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Sammy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say
you do not understand me?&nbsp; Eh! look you then, I will tell
you; I do understand you!&nbsp; Up in our mountains, we have one
man there, we do call him exciseman; he comes along to our shops
and stores, and says, &lsquo;What have you here?&nbsp; Anything
contraband here?&rsquo;&nbsp; And if it is all right, the good
man says, &lsquo;Step in, Mr. Exciseman, come in, look
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is all fair, open, and above-board.&nbsp;
But if he has anything secreted there, he does draw back
surprised, and he makes a fine face, and says, &lsquo;Sir, I do
not understand you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, you do tell me that you
don&rsquo;t understand me, but I do understand you, gentlemen, I
do; and I do fear you have something contraband here; and I will
say good-night to you; but I must tell you one little word; that
is: &lsquo;He that believeth shall be saved, and he that
believeth not shall be damned,&rsquo; <i>and I begs no
pardons</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, with these simple illustrations, we have not exhausted
the number of noticeable names.&nbsp; In connection with every
name as it occurs, some interesting anecdote meets the
memory.&nbsp; There was Robert Lloyd, the shoemaker, and Thomas
the turner, and Robert Roberts, of whom, from the stories before
us, we do not find it difficult to believe, that he had the power
to describe things in such a vivid, and graphic manner, as to
make his hearers feel as if the scenes were passing before their
eyes.&nbsp; Then there were David Evans of Aberayron, and
Ebenezer Richard of Tregaron, and William Morris of St. <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>David&rsquo;s, whose every sermon was said to be a
string of sparkling gems; John Jones of Talysarn, and his
brother, David Jones; John Hughes; the seraphic Henry Rees, and
Thomas Philips, and many another name, concerning whom an
illustration might be furnished, of their powers of wit, wisdom,
or eloquence.&nbsp; England, itself, has been indebted, in many a
circle, to eminent Welsh preachers, who have stimulated thought,
created the sphere of holy usefulness, moved over the minds of
cultivated members with the freshness of a mountain wind, or a
mountain stream.&nbsp; It would be invidious to mention their
names&mdash;many are yet living; and some, who have not long
quitted the Church on earth, have still left behind them the
fragrance of loved, and honoured names, and exalted, and earnest
labours.</p>
<p>Few of our readers, we may suppose, can be unacquainted with
the name, and memory of &ldquo;The Man of Ross,&rdquo; so famous
through the verses of Pope.&nbsp; Ross is a well-known little
town in Monmouthshire, on the banks of the Wye, on the borders of
Wales.&nbsp; There, in the parish church, in the pew in which
John Kyrle, the Man of Ross, sat, more than a hundred years
since, a curious sight may be seen: two elm-trees rise, and
spread out their arms, and flourish within the church; especially
during the spring, and summer months, they form a singular
adornment to the sacred edifice.&nbsp; The tradition is, that
they are suckers from a tree planted by the &ldquo;Man of
Ross,&rdquo; outside the church; but it was cut down by a certain
rector, because it excluded the light; the consequence was that
they forced their way inside, where they had continued to grow,
and <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>flourish.&nbsp; As we have looked upon the singular
sight of those trees, in the Man of Ross&rsquo;s pew, we have
often thought of those who, in Wales, planted in the house of the
Lord, flourish in sacred, and sainted memories, in the courts of
our God.&nbsp; Although all that was mortal of them has passed
away, they still bring forth fruit, and flourish in the grateful
recollections of the country, they were permitted to bless, and
adorn.</p>
<p>Yes, it is very singular to think of many of these men of Wild
Wales.&nbsp; Even those who were counted heretical, were more
than extraordinary men; they were, perhaps, men who, in our day,
would seem rather remarkable for their orthodoxy of
sentiment.&nbsp; Rhys Stephen, in an extended note in his Memoirs
of Christmas Evans, refers to the influence of discussions, in
the Principality, raised by the Rev. <span class="smcap">William
Richards</span>, LL.D.&nbsp; A large portion of the ministerial
life of this distinguished man, was passed in England; he was
educated for the ministry at the Baptist Academy in Bristol, for
some time co-pastor with Dr. Ash, author of the Dictionary, and
then became the minister of the Baptist Church at Lynn, in
Norfolk, where he remained for twenty years.&nbsp; He always
continued, however, in every sense of the word, a Welshman, and,
notwithstanding his English pastorates, his residences in Wales
were frequent and long.</p>
<p>He was born at Pen-hydd, in Pembrokeshire, in 1749.&nbsp; He
published a Welsh-English dictionary, and his services to Welsh
literature were eminent.&nbsp; But he was regarded as a heretic;
his temperament, singular as it seems in a Welshman, was almost
<a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>purely
philosophic, and neither imaginative, nor emotional; he disliked
the great annual religious gatherings of his countrymen, and
called them fairs, and the preachers, upon these occasions, he
sometimes described in epithets, which were not
complimentary.&nbsp; Naturally, his brethren paid him back; they
called him a heretic,&mdash;which is also an exceedingly
convenient, and not unusual method of revenge.&nbsp; Dr.
Richards&rsquo;s influence, however, in Wales, at the beginning
of this century, appears to have been very great; the charges
against him, he does not appear to have been very mindful to
disprove, and it is exceedingly likely that a different, or more
guarded mode of expression, was the height of his
offending.&nbsp; Who can fathom, or delineate, all the fine
shades and divergencies of the Arian controversy?&mdash;men whose
perfect soundness, in evangelical doctrine, was utterly
undisputed, talked with Dr. Richards, and said, that they could
not discover that he held opinions different from their
own.&nbsp; In a letter, dated December 7th, 1804, when grave
charges had been urged against him, and all the religious
mischiefs throughout the Principality ascribed to him, he writes
as follows, to a friend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think I may safely say, that no great
change, of any kind, has taken place in my sentiments since I
knew you.&nbsp; You must know, surely, that I did not use to be
an <i>Athanasian</i>, or even a <i>Waterlandian</i>.&nbsp; Such
views of the Deity always appeared to me too
<i>Tritheistical</i>.&nbsp; I have been used to think, and do so
still, that there is a particular meaning in such words as these
of the Apostle&rsquo;s, &lsquo;To us there is but one God, the
Father;&rsquo; but I never could say, or think, <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>with the
Socinians, that Jesus Christ is no more than <i>a man</i>, like
ourselves.&nbsp; I believe, indeed, that He is a Man; but I,
also, believe that He is &lsquo;Emmanuel, God with
us&rsquo;&mdash;that he is &lsquo;the form of
God&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the image of the invisible
God&rsquo;&mdash;an object of Divine worship, so that we should
&lsquo;honour the Son as we honour the
Father&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;that all the fulness of the Godhead
dwells in Him bodily,&rsquo; or substantially.&nbsp; In short, I
believe everything of the dignity, and glory of Christ&rsquo;s
character, that does not <i>divide</i> the Deity, or land in
<i>Tritheism</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, to another correspondent: &ldquo;I believe, also, in
the doctrine of the atonement, or sacrifice, of Christ, in the
virtue of His blood, and in the prevalence of His
mediation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of the same order of man, so far as sentiment, and
knowledge are indications, but possessed of more wit,
imagination, and emotion, was <span class="smcap">Davies</span>,
of <span class="smcap">Castell Hywel</span>, the first pastor of
Christmas Evans, and of Daniel Davies, of Swansea.&nbsp; He was,
in his day, a man of many-sided reputation, but of suspicious
doctrinal relations.&nbsp; He was so eminent a classical scholar,
and so many of the Welsh clergy had received their education from
him, that when Dr. Horsley was appointed Bishop of St.
David&rsquo;s, he expressed, in his usual passionate manner, his
irritation that the most distinguished tutor in South Wales was a
Nonconformist, and gave out that he would not ordain any of Mr.
Davies&rsquo; pupils.&nbsp; Davies was a great bard; and Welshmen
who know both languages, say that his translation of Gray&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Elegy&rdquo; is, in force, and pathos, superior to the
original.&nbsp; This will scarcely seem strange, if the deep
pathos of the <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>Welsh language be taken into account.&nbsp; His epitaph
on Dr. Priestley&mdash;satirizing, of course, the materialism of
Priestley&mdash;illustrates, at once, his humour, and
versification:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies at rest, in oaken chest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together packed most nicely,<br />
The bones, and brains, flesh, blood, and veins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>soul</i> of Dr. Priestley!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an illustration of his readiness of wit, a story is told,
how one of the most noted of the Welsh bards one day met him,
while the rain was streaming down upon him.&nbsp; Umbrellas,
probably, were scarce.&nbsp; He was covered with layers of straw,
fastened round with ropes of the same material; in fact, thatched
all over.&nbsp; To him his brother bard exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, bard and teacher, famed afar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such sight I never saw!<br />
It ill becomes a house like yours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To have a roof of straw.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Davies instantly replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The rain is falling fast, my friend;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You know not what you say,<br />
A roof of straw, methinks, doth well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beseem a wall of clay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was Christmas Evans&rsquo;s first &ldquo;guide,
philosopher, and friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if we refer to certain characteristics of the Welsh
language, which make it eminently fine furniture for
preaching-power, to these may be added, what we have not so
particularly dwelt on, but which does follow, as a part of the
same remark&mdash;the singular <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>proverbial power of the Welsh
language.&nbsp; In reading great Welsh sermons, and listening to
Welsh preachers, we have often felt how much the spirit of their
own triads, and the manner of old Catwg the Wise, and other such
sententious bards, falls into their modern method.&nbsp; Welsh
proverbs are the delightful recreations of the
arch&aelig;ologists of the old Welsh language.&nbsp; Here, while
we write these lines, we have piles of these proverbial
utterances before us; short, compact sayings, wherever they come
from, but which have been repeated on, from generation to
generation.&nbsp; The Bardic triads, for instance, relating to
language, selected by Mr. Owen Pugh,&mdash;how admirable they are
for any preacher!&nbsp; They may stand as the characteristics of
their most eminent men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three indispensables of language&mdash;purity,
copiousness, and aptness; the three supports of
language&mdash;order, strength, and harmony; the three uses of
language&mdash;to relate, to describe, to excite; the correct
qualities of language,&mdash;correct construction, correct
etymology, and correct pronunciation; three marks of the purity
of language&mdash;the intelligible, the pleasurable, the
credible; three things that constitute just
description&mdash;just selection of words, just construction of
language, and just comparison; three things appertaining to just
selection&mdash;the best language, the best order, and the best
object.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must be admitted, we think, that, in
these old triads, there is much of the compact wisdom of a
primeval people, with whom books were few, and thoughts were
fresh, and constant.&nbsp; There seemed to be a singular
propensity, in the old mind of Wales, to <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>throw
everything into the form of a trinity of expression, or to bind
up words, as far as possible, in short, sententious
utterances.&nbsp; Catwg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay on
Metaphysics&rdquo; is a very brief, and concise one, but it
illustrates that rapid running-up-the-ladder kind of style, which
has always been the delight of the Welsh poet or teacher.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In every person there is a soul.&nbsp; In
every soul there is intelligence.&nbsp; In every intelligence
there is thought.&nbsp; In every thought there is either good, or
evil.&nbsp; In every evil there is death; in every good there is
life.&nbsp; In every life there is God; and there is no God but
He than whom there can be none better.&nbsp; There is nothing
that cannot have its better, save the best of all.&nbsp; There is
no best of all except love.&nbsp; There is no love but God.&nbsp;
God is love!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Illustrations of this kind fill volumes.&nbsp; It is not for
us here to say how much of the admirable, or the imitable there
may be in the method.&nbsp; It was the method of the old Welsh
mind; it was the method into which many of the best preachers
fell, not because they, perhaps, knew so much of the words of the
bards, as because it represented the mind of the race.&nbsp; Take
a few of the Welsh proverbs.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that is intent upon going, will do no
good before he departs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one has his neighbour for a mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is shallowest where it bubbles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lie is the quickest traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fame outlives riches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that is unlucky at sea, will be unlucky on
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always time for meat, and for
prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;He mows the meadow with shears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calumny comes from envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every bird loves its own voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life of a man is not at the disposal of his
enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that loves the young, must love their
sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prudence is unmarried without patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that is the head, should become the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three things come unawares upon a man: sleep, sin, and
old age.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is not only that this sententious characteristic of the
Welsh language makes it a vehicle for the transparent expression
of sentiment; even our translations cannot altogether disguise
the pathetic tones of the language, and bursts of feeling.&nbsp;
The following verse of an old Welsh prayer, which, a <i>Quarterly
Reviewer</i> tells us, used to form, with the Creed and Ten
Commandments, part of the peasant&rsquo;s daily devotion,
illustrates this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mother, O mother! tell me, art thou
weeping?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The infant Saviour asked, on
Mary&rsquo;s breast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Child of th&rsquo; Eternal, nay; I am but
sleeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though vexed by many a thought of
dark unrest.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say, at what vision is thy courage
failing?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see a crown of
thorns, and bitter pain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thee, dread Child, upon the cross of wailing,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All heaven aghast, at rude
mankind&rsquo;s disdain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is singular that Mr. Borrow found, on an old tombstone, an
epitaph, which most of our readers will remember, as very like
that famous one Sir Walter Scott gives us, from an old tomb, in a
note to &ldquo;The Lay of the Last Minstrel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
following is a translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>&ldquo;Thou earth, from earth, reflect, with anxious
mind,<br />
That earth to earth must quickly be consigned;<br />
And earth in earth must lie entranced, enthralled,<br />
Till earth from earth to judgment shall be called.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following lines also struck Mr. Borrow as remarkably
beautiful, of which he gives us this translation.&nbsp; They are
an inscription in a garden:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In a garden the first of our race was
deceived;<br />
In a garden the promise of grace was received;<br />
In a garden was Jesus betrayed to His doom;<br />
In a garden His body was laid in the tomb.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such verses are very illustrative of the alliterative
character of the Welsh mind.</p>
<p>But Wales, in its way&mdash;and no classical reader must smile
at the assertion&mdash;was once quite as much the land of song as
Italy.&nbsp; Among the amusements of the people was the singing
of &ldquo;Pennilion,&rdquo; a sort of epigrammatic poem, and of
an improvisatorial character, testing the readiness of rural
wit.&nbsp; With this exercise there came to be associated, in
later days, a sort of rude mystery, or comedy, performed in very
much the same manner as the old monkish mysteries of the dark
ages.&nbsp; These furnished an opportunity for satirizing any of
the unpopular characters of the village, or the
Principality.&nbsp; Such mental characteristics, showing that
there was a living mind in the country, must be remembered, when
we attempt to estimate the power which extraordinary preachers
soon attained, over the minds of their countrymen.&nbsp; Then, no
doubt, although there might be exceptions, and a Welshman prove
that he could be as stupid as anybody else, in general there was
a keen love, <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>and admiration of nature.&nbsp; The names of places
show this.&nbsp; Mr. Borrow illustrates both characters in an
anecdote.&nbsp; He met an old man, and his son, at the foot of
the great mountain, called Tap-Nyth-yr Eryri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does not that mean,&rdquo; said Mr. Borrow, &ldquo;the
top nest of the eagles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I see you
understand Welsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&nbsp; Are there eagles there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! no eagle now; eagle left Tap-Nyth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that young man your son?&rdquo; said Mr. Borrow,
after a little pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he any English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he no English, but he plenty of Welsh; that is, if
he see reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke to the young man, in Welsh,
asking him if he had ever been up to the Tap-Nyth; but he made no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He no care for your question,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;ask him price of pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the young fellow the price of hogs,&rdquo; says
Mr. Borrow, &ldquo;whereupon his face brightened up, and he not
only answered my question, but told me that he had a fat hog to
sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;he plenty of
Welsh now, for he see reason; to other question he no Welsh at
all, no more than English, for he see no reason.&nbsp; What
business he on Tap-Nyth, with eagle?&nbsp; His business down
below in sty with pig.&nbsp; Ah! he look lump, but he no
fool.&nbsp; Know more about pig than you, or I, or anyone,
&rsquo;twixt here and Machunleth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>It
has been said, that the inhabitants of a mountainous country
cannot be insensible to religion, and whether, or not this is
universally true, it is, certainly, true of Wales.&nbsp; The
magnificent scenery seems to create a pensive awe upon the
spirit.&nbsp; Often the pedestrian, passing along a piece of
unsuggestive road, suddenly finds that the stupendous mountains
have sloped down, to valleys of the wildest, and most picturesque
beauty, valley opening into valley, in some instances; in others,
as in the vale of Glamorgan, stretching along, for many miles, in
plenteous fruitfulness, and beauty, illuminated by some river
like the Tivy, the Towy, or the Llugg, some of these rivers
sparkling, and flashing with the glittering <i>gleisiad</i>, as
an old Welsh song sings it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Glan yw&rsquo;r gleisiad yn y
llyn</i>,<br />
Full fair the <i>gleisiad</i> in the flood<br />
Which sparkles &rsquo;neath the summer&rsquo;s sun.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The<i> gleisiad</i> is the salmon.&nbsp; We have dwelt on the
word here, for the purpose of calling the reader&rsquo;s
attention to its beautiful expressiveness.&nbsp; It seems to
convey the whole idea of the fish&mdash;its silvery splendour,
gleaming, and glancing through the lynn.</p>
<p>It seems rather in the nature of the Welsh mind, to take
instantly a pensive, and sombre idea of things.&nbsp; A
traveller, walking beneath a fine row of elms, expressed his
admiration of them to a Welsh companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,
sir,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll make fine chests
for the dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was very nationally characteristic,
and hence, perhaps, it is that the owl (the <i>dylluan</i>) among
birds, has received some of the most famous traditions of the
Welsh language.&nbsp; Mr. <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>Borrow thought there was no cry so
wild, as the cry of the <i>dylluan</i>&mdash;&ldquo;unlike any
other sound in nature,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a cry, which no
combination of letters can give the slightest idea of;&rdquo;
and, surely, that Welsh name far better realizes it, than the
<i>tu whit tu whoo</i> of our Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Certainly, it is not in a page, or two, that we can give
anything like an adequate idea of that compacted poetry, which
meets us in Wales, whether we think of the varied scenery of the
country, of the nervous, and descriptive language, or of its race
of people, so imaginative, and speculative.</p>
<p>It ought to be mentioned, also, as quite as distinctly
characteristic, that there is an intense clannishness prevalent
throughout the Principality.&nbsp; Communication between the
people has no doubt somewhat modified this; but, usually, an
Englishman resident in Wales, and especially in the more
sequestered regions, has seldom found himself in very comfortable
circumstances.&nbsp; The Welsh have a suspicion that there are
precious secrets in their land, and language, of which the
English are desirous to avail themselves.&nbsp; And, perhaps,
there is some extenuation in the recollection that we, as their
conquerors, have seldom given them reason to think well of
us.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1826 that Christmas Evans, now sixty-two
years of age, left Anglesea, accepting an invitation to the
Baptist Church at Tonyvelin, in Caerphilly.&nbsp; His ministry at
Anglesea had been long, affectionate, and very successful; but,
dear as Anglesea was to him, he had to leave it, and he left it,
as we have seen, under circumstances not honourable to the
neighbouring ministers, or the churches of which he had been the
patriarchal pastor.&nbsp; Little doubt can there be, that even he
suffered from the jealousy of inferior minds, and characters; so
old as he was, so venerable, and such a household name as his had
become, throughout all Wales, it might have been thought that he
would not have been permitted to <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>depart.&nbsp; He left the dust of
his beloved wife, the long companion of his Cildwrn cottage,
behind him, and commenced his tedious journey to his new
home.&nbsp; He had about two hundred miles to travel, and the
travelling was not easy; travelling in Wales was altogether
unrelated to the more comfortable, and commodious modes of
conveyance in England, even in that day; and now he would have to
cross a dangerous ferry, and now to mount a rugged, and toilsome
hill, to wind slowly along by the foot of some gigantic mountain,
to wend through a long, winding valley, or across an extensive
plain.&nbsp; As the old man passed along, he says he experienced
great tenderness of mind, and the presence of Christ by his
side.&nbsp; A long, solitary journey! he says, he was enabled to
entrust the care of his ministry to Jesus Christ, with the
confidence that He would deliver him from all his afflictions; he
says, &ldquo;I again made a covenant with God which I never
wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caerphilly would seem a very singular spot in which to settle
one of the most remarkable men, if not the most remarkable, in
the pulpit of his country, and his time,&mdash;beyond all
question, the most distinguished in his own denomination, there,
and then.&nbsp; Even now, probably, very few of our readers have
ever heard of Caerphilly; it is nearly forty years since the
writer of the present pages was there, and there, in a Welsh
cottage, heard from the lips of an old Welsh dame the most
graphic outlines he has ever heard, or read, of some of the
sermons of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; Since that day, we suppose
Caerphilly may have grown nearer to the dignity of a little town,
sharing some of the honours which have so lavishly <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>fallen upon
its great, and prosperous neighbour, Cardiff.</p>
<p>Caerphilly, however insignificant, as it lies in its mountain
valley, a poor little village when Christmas Evans was there, has
its own eminent claims to renown: tradition says&mdash;and, in
this instance, tradition is, probably, correct&mdash;that it was
once the seat of a large town.&nbsp; There, certainly, still
stands the vast ruins of Caerphilly Castle, once the largest in
all Great Britain next to Windsor, and still the most extensive
ruin; here was the retreat of the ill-fated Edward II.; here was
that great siege, during which the King escaped in the depth of a
dark, and stormy night, in the disguise of a Welsh peasant,
flying to the parish of Llangonoyd, twenty miles to the west,
where he hired himself at a farm, which, it is said, is still
pointed out, or the spot where once it stood, the site made
memorable, through all these ages, by so singular a
circumstance.&nbsp; This was the siege in which that grand, and
massive tower was rent, and which still so singularly leans, and
hangs there,&mdash;the leaning tower of Caerphilly, as wonderful
an object as the leaning tower of Pisa, a wonder in Wales which
few have visited.</p>
<p>After this period, it was occupied by Glendower; gradually,
however, it became only famous for the rapacity of its lords, the
Spencers, who plundered their vassals, and the inhabitants of the
region in general, so that from this circumstance arose a Welsh
proverb, &ldquo;It is gone to
Caerphilly,&rdquo;&mdash;signifying, says Malkin, that a thing is
irrecoverably lost, and used on occasions when an Englishman, not
very nice, and select in his language, would say, &ldquo;It is
gone to the <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gloomy ideas were associated for
long ages with Caerphilly, as the seat of horror, and rapacity;
it had an awful tower for prisoners, its ruinous walls were of
wondrous thickness, and it was set amidst desolate marshes.</p>
<p>And this was the spot to which Christmas Evans was consigned
for some of the closing years of his life; but, perhaps, our
readers can have no idea of the immense excitement his transit
thither caused to the good people of the village, and its
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Our readers will remember, what we have
already said, that a small village by no means implied a small
congregation.&nbsp; His arrival at Caerphilly was looked upon as
an event in the history of the region round about; for until he
was actually there, it was believed that his heart would fail him
at last, and that he would never be able to leave Anglesea.</p>
<p>It is said that all denominations, and all conditions of
people, caught up, and propagated the report, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Christmas Evans is come</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Are you sure of it</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Yes</span>, <i>quite sure of it</i>; <i>he preached
at Caerphilly last Sunday</i>!&nbsp; I know a friend who was
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; These poor scattered villagers, how foolish,
to us, seems their enthusiasm, and frantic joy, because they had
their country&rsquo;s great preaching bard in their midst; almost
as foolish as those insane Florentines, who burst into tears and
acclamations as they greeted one of the great pictures of
Cimabue, and reverently thronged round it in a kind of triumphal
procession.&nbsp; What makes it more remarkable, is that they
should love a man as poor, as he was old.&nbsp; If they could
revere him as, wearied and dusty, he came along after his tedious
two hundred miles&rsquo; journey, spent, <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>and
exhausted, what an affluence of affection they would have poured
forth had he rode into Caerphilly, as the old satirist has it, in
a coach, and six!</p>
<p>Well, he was settled in the chapel-house, and a housekeeper
was provided for him.&nbsp; In domestic matters, however, he did
not seem to get on very well.&nbsp; North, and South Wales
appeared different to him, and he said to a friend, he must get a
servant from the north.&nbsp; It was suggested to him, that he
might do better than that, that he had better marry again, and
the name of an excellent woman was mentioned, who would have been
probably not unwilling; and she had wealth, so that he might have
bettered his entire worldly circumstances by the alliance, and
have made himself pleasantly independent of churches, and
deacons, and county associations; and when it was first suggested
to him, he seemed to think for a moment, and then broke out into
a cheerful laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
tell you, brother, it is my firm opinion that I am never to have
any property in the soil of this world, until I have a
grave;&rdquo; and he would talk no more on the subject, but he
took a good brother minister of the neighbourhood into his
counsel, Mr. Davies, of Argoed, and he persuaded him to take his
horse, and to go for him to Anglesea, and to bring back with him
the old, and faithful servant of himself, and his departed wife,
Mary Evans; and, in a short time, he married her, and she paid
him every tribute of untiring, and devoted affection, to the last
moment of his life.&nbsp; A really foolish man, you see, this
Christmas Evans, and, as many no doubt said, old as he was, he
might have done so much better for himself.&nbsp; It <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>is not
uninteresting to notice a circumstance, which Mr. Rhys Stephen
discovered, that Christmas Evans was married the second time in
the same parish of Eglwysilian, in Glamorganshire, the church in
which George Whitefield was married: the parish register contains
both their names.</p>
<p>And what will our readers think, when they find that those who
knew Christmas Evans, both at this, and previous periods of his
history, declare that his preaching now surpassed that of any
previous period?&nbsp; Certainly, his ministry was gloriously
successful at Caerphilly.&nbsp; Caerphilly, the village in the
valley, became like a city set upon a hill; every Sabbath,
multitudes might be seen, wending their way across the
surrounding hills, in all directions.&nbsp; The homes of the
neighbourhood rang, and re-echoed with Christmas Evans&rsquo;s
sermons; his morning sermon, especially, would be the subject of
conversation, in hundreds of homes, many miles away, that
evening.&nbsp; The old dame with whom we drank our cup of tea, in
her pleasant cottage at Caerphilly, near forty years since,
talked, with tears, of those old days.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;We
used to reckon things as they happened, by Christmas
Evans&rsquo;s sermons; people used to say, &lsquo;It must have
happened then, because that was the time when Christmas Evans
preached The Wedding Ring,&rsquo; or The Seven Eyes, or some
other sermon which had been quite a book-mark in the
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt, many grand sermons belong to the Caerphilly period:
there is one which reads, to us, like an especial triumph; it was
preached some time after he settled in the south; the subject
was, &ldquo;God manifest in the flesh, justified in the
spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>grand drama in this sermon was the
examination of the evidences of Christ&rsquo;s
resurrection:&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Trial of the
Witnesses</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The enemies of Christ, after His death,
applied for a military guard to watch at His tomb, and this
application for a military guard was rested on the fact, that the
&lsquo;impostor&rsquo; had said, in His lifetime, that He would
rise again on the third day.&nbsp; Without a doubt, had they
found His body in the grave, when the time had transpired, they
would have torn it from the sepulchre, exhibited it through the
streets of Jerusalem, where Jesus had preached, where He had been
despitefully used, and scourged; they would have shouted forth
with triumph, &lsquo;This is the body of the
impostor!&rsquo;&nbsp; But He had left the grave, that morning,
too early for them.&nbsp; The soldiers came back to the city, and
they went to the leaders of the people who had employed them, and
the leaders exclaimed, &lsquo;Here is the watch!&nbsp; What is
the matter?&nbsp; What is that dread settled in their
faces?&nbsp; Come in here, and we charge you to tell the
truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You have no need to charge us, for the
fright, the terror of it, is still upon us.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;How?&nbsp; What has happened at the grave?&nbsp; Did His
disciples come, and take Him away?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They! no;
but if they had, our spears would have sufficed for
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, but how was it?&nbsp; What has
taken place?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, see; while we were on the
watch, and early, in the dawn of the morning, a great earthquake,
like to that one that took place on Friday afternoon, <i>when He
died</i>, and we all fell powerless to the ground; and we saw
angels, bright, like the lightning; we were not able to bear the
sight; we looked down at once; we endeavoured, again, to raise
our eyes, and we beheld One coming out of the grave, but He
passed by the first angel we saw, who now was sitting on the
removed stone; but He who came out of the grave! we never saw one
like unto Him before,&mdash;truly He was like <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>unto the
Son of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What, then, became of the
angel?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, a legion of them came down, and
one of them, very fair, like a young man, entered the grave, and
sat where the head of Jesus had lain; and, immediately, another,
also, very fair, and beautiful, sat where His feet had
rested.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And did the angels say nothing to
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, but they looked with eyes of
lightning.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Saw you not His friends, the
women?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, yes; they came there, but He had
left the tomb before their arrival.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Talked
the angels to the women?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes; they seemed to
be of one family, and very well acquainted with one
another.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you remember anything of the
conversation?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes; they said, &ldquo;Fear you
not! let the Pharisees, and Darkness fear to-day!&nbsp; You seek
Jesus!&nbsp; He is not here, for He is risen indeed; He is alive,
and lives for ever.&nbsp; He has gone before you to
Galilee.&rdquo;&nbsp; We heard one angel say, &ldquo;Come, see
the place where the Lord lay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another angel spoke to
a woman called Mary, and said, &ldquo;Why weepest <i>thou</i>,
while thy Lord is risen indeed, and is alive, so near unto thee?
<i>let His enemies weep to-day</i>!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">What</span>!&rsquo; exclaimed the
leader of those priests, and of the council, who had asked for
the guard,&mdash;&lsquo;What! how say you?&nbsp; <i>Close that
door</i>!&nbsp; You, <i>tall</i> soldier, approach: was it not
you who pierced His side?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, it was I; but
all that these soldiers have said is all true; oh, alas! it is
all true!&nbsp; He must have been the Son of God.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Pharisees lost their cause, on the day of their appeal; they
gave the soldiers money, to say that His disciples had stolen the
body while they slept!&nbsp; <i>If they were asleep</i>, <i>how
did they know in what manner He had left the grave</i>?&nbsp;
They, however, suffered themselves to be suborned, and for money
lied, and, to this hour, the kingdom of Satan hangs upon that
lie!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sermon produced a profound impression.&nbsp; We have
said, to render the sermons of Christmas Evans in print, or by
description, is impossible,&mdash;as impossible <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>as to paint
tones, and accents, or the varying expressions which pass over
eye, and face, and lip.&nbsp; He was entreated to publish this
sermon, but he could only write out something like an outline of
it, and when it appeared in print, those who had been enraptured
with it, in its delivery, declared that it was not the same
sermon; so he was entreated to preach the sermon again.&nbsp; He
made a humorous remark, on the strangeness of a man preaching his
own printed sermon; still, he complied.&nbsp; His accomplished
biographer, Rhys Stephen, heard it then, and says of it,
&ldquo;While I have the faintest trace of memory, as to sermons I
have heard, this must always be pre-eminent, and distinct; in its
oratorical eminence, it stands alone, even among his great
achievements.&nbsp; One of the most striking parts of the sermon,
was in the examination of the Roman guard, the report of the
soldiers to the authorities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Stephens continues,
&ldquo;We heard them talk, had a clear perception of the
difference of the tone, and more especially, when one of the
chief priests, in an anxious, agonizing whisper, said,
&lsquo;<i>Shut the door</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, &lsquo;You,
tall soldier, approach: was it not you who pierced His
side?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, it was I.&rsquo;&nbsp; When
Christmas Evans simulated the chief priest, and singled out the
tall soldier, and the conversation went on between the two, such
a combined triumph of sanctified fancy, and perfect oratory, I
never expect to witness again.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may, also, say,
that it illustrates wherein, very greatly, lay the
preacher&rsquo;s power,&mdash;seizing some little circumstance,
and, by its homeliness, or aptness, giving reality, and vivacity
to the whole picture.</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>It
must be said, his are very great sermons; the present writer is
almost disposed to be bold enough to describe them, as the
grandest Gospel sermons of the last hundred years.&nbsp; Not one,
or two, but several, are especially noble.&nbsp; One of these we
have, already, given: the splendid embodiment, and
personification of the twenty-second Psalm, <i>The Hind of the
Morning</i>, from the singular, and most significant designation,
or title of the Psalm itself.</p>
<p>Another sermon which, probably, belongs to this period is</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">The Bible regarded as a Stone with Seven
Eyes</span>,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>evidently from Zech. iii. 9, &ldquo;<i>Upon one stone shall be
seven eyes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a review of</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<i>The Internal Evidences which prove the Gospel to be
of God</i>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s perfections are, in some sort,
to be seen in all He has done, and in all He has spoken.&nbsp; He
imprints some indication of His character, on everything that His
hand forms, and that His mouth utters, so that there might be a
sufficient difference between the work, and the speech of God,
and those of man.&nbsp; The Bible is the Book of books, a book
breathed out of heaven.&nbsp; It was easy enough for John to
determine, when he saw the Lamb, with the seven horns, and the
seven eyes, in the midst of the throne, that the Godhead was
there, and that such a Lamb was not to be found amongst
creatures.&nbsp; When one saw a stone, with seven eyes, before
Zerubbabel, it was not difficult to conclude that it was a stone
from some unusual mine.&nbsp; In looking at the page of the
starry sky, the work of the fingers of the Everlasting Power is
traced in the sun, and moon, and stars; all proclaim His name,
and tell His glory.&nbsp; I am very <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>thankful for books written by man,
but it is God&rsquo;s book that sheds the light of the life
everlasting on all other books.&nbsp; I cannot often read it,
hear it, or reflect upon it, but I see&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; <i>Eternity</i>, like a great fiery Eye,
looking at me from the everlasting, and the infinite distance,
unfolding mysteries, and opening before me the doors, windows,
and chambers, in the (otherwise) unknown, and awful state!&nbsp;
This Eye leads me to the source, and cause of all things, and
places me in the presence, and sight of the Almighty, who has in
Him something that would destroy me for ever, and yet something
that spares, and animates me; pressing me down, and at the same
time, saying, &lsquo;Fear not;&rsquo; something that melts me
into penitence, and, at once, causes me to rejoice in the faith,
inspiring me with the fear of joy; something that creates a wish
in me, to conceal myself from Him, and then a stronger wish, to
stay, for ever, in the light of His countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; <i>Omniscience</i> looks at me, also, like a
Divine Eye, out of every chapter, verse, doctrine, and ordinance
of the Gospel, and searches me through and through.&nbsp; The
attempt at concealment from it is utterly vain.&nbsp; To this
Eye, darkness is as the light.&nbsp; It has descried, correctly,
into the deepest abysses of my spirit; and it has truthfully
drawn my likeness before I received God&rsquo;s grace; having
received it; and the future is, also, transparent before
it.&nbsp; There is something in the scanning of this Eye, that
obliges me to confess, against myself, my sins unto the Lord; and
to cry out for a new heart, and a right spirit; for the Author of
the Book knows all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; When I yield to pensive reflections, under a
sense of sin, and when I see the tops of dark mountains of
disease, and trouble at the terrors of the grave, I see in the
Bible <i>Infinite Goodness</i>, fairer than the Shekinah of old,
looking at me, out of eternity; it is like the smile of the
Eternal King, from His throne of mercy.&nbsp; Divine love, merits
of Christ, riches of grace, they are all here, and they assure
me, and I listen to the still, small voice, that follows in its
train, until I <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>feel myself lifted up, out of the cave of despair, by
the dark mountain; and I stand on my feet, and I hope, and hear
the proclamation of the great mystery&mdash;&lsquo;Behold, I
come, as it is written in the roll of the Book.&nbsp; If I must
die, I am willing to die; for I come to seek, and to save that
which is lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; <i>Holiness</i>, <i>righteousness</i>, and
<i>purity</i> look at me, out of the midst of the Book, like the
fires of Sinai to Israel, or the I AM, out of the burning bush;
causing me to fear, and tremble, while I am yet desirous of
looking at the radiant glory, because it is attempered with
mercy.&nbsp; I take my shoes from off my feet, and approach on my
knees, to see this great sight.&nbsp; I cannot live, in sin, in
this presence,&mdash;still it does not slay me.&nbsp; The Eternal
Power is here, and, with one hand, it conceals me, in the shadow
of redeeming mercy, and, with the other, it points out the glory
of the great, and wondrous truth, that God is, at once, a just
God, and justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.&nbsp; Where
Thy glory rests, O my God, there let me have my abode!</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; I also see <i>Infinite might</i> radiating
from the doctrine of the Book, like God&rsquo;s own Eye, having
the energy of a sharp, two-edged sword.&nbsp; Without asking
permission of me, it proves itself &lsquo;quick and powerful, and
pierces even to the dividing asunder of the soul, and spirit, and
of the joints, and marrow;&rsquo; it opens the private recesses
of my heart, and becomes a discerner, and judge of its thoughts,
and intents.&nbsp; When Lord Rochester, the great wit, and
unbeliever of his day, read Isa. liii. 5, &lsquo;He was wounded
for our transgressions,&rsquo; etc., Divine energies entered his
spirit, and did so thoroughly pierce, and pervade it, that his
infidelity died within him, and he gladly received the faith, and
hope that are in Christ.&nbsp; The power of the Gospel visited
Matthew, at the receipt of custom, the woman at the well of
Samaria, the malefactor on the cross, the converts on the day of
Pentecost, Paul by the way, and the jailer at Philippi; in them
all was exerted this resistless might of grace, the &lsquo;<i>Let
</i><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span><i>there be</i>&rsquo; of the original creation, which
none can withstand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; When I am weak, and <i>distressed</i>, and
<i>alone</i>, and none to receive my tale of sorrow, none to
express a word of fellow-feeling, or of care for me, in the
living oracles of the Gospel I see Divine wisdom, and
loving-kindness, looking at me tenderly, compassionately, through
the openings of my prison, and I feel that He, who dresses the
lily of the field, and numbers the sparrows, is near me,
numbering the hairs of my head, listening to my cries; and in all
the treasure of grace, and power, that was able to say to the
lost one, at the very door of the pit, &lsquo;To-day shalt thou
be with me in Paradise,&rsquo; fearing no hindrances that might
intervene, between Golgotha and heaven, He is the same gracious
Redeemer, and Preserver to every one, that believes in His
name.&nbsp; Who will teach me the way of wisdom? who will guide
me to her dwelling-place?&nbsp; It was in the Gospel that wisdom
came to reside near me, and here she teaches the most untoward,
convinces the most hard-hearted, reforms the most licentious, and
makes the simple wise unto salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; <i>I am sometimes filled with questions of
anxious import</i>.&nbsp; Art thou from heaven, O Gospel?&nbsp;
Thou hast caused me to hope: Art thou a rock?&nbsp; The reply:
Dost thou not see, in my face, the true character of God, and of
the Eternal Power Incarnate?&nbsp; Dost thou not discern, in
Jesus, the image of the invisible God, which, unlike the first
Adam, the second Adam has preserved untarnished? and dost thou
not feel, in looking at it, thyself gradually changed into the
same image, even as by the Spirit of the Lord?&nbsp; In looking
at God&rsquo;s image in the creature, the vision had no
transforming power, but left &lsquo;the wise men&rsquo; of the
ancient world where it found them, destitute of true knowledge,
and happiness, without hope, and without God in the world; but
here the vision transforms into the glorious likeness of the
sublime object, even Christ.</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&ldquo;<i>The character of God</i>, given in the
Gospel, is complete, and perfect, worthy of the most blessed One,
and there is no perfect portraiture given of Him but in the
Gospel.&nbsp; Mohammed&rsquo;s God is <i>unchaste</i>; Homer gave
his Jupiter <i>revenge</i>; Voltaire deified <i>mockery</i>;
Insurrection and War were the gods of Paine;&mdash;but the
character of the God of the Gospel is awful in truth, and lovely
in goodness.&nbsp; In Isa. vi., the vision of the Divine glory
caused the six-winged cherubs to conceal their faces; but in Rev.
iv., the six-winged living things employ five wings to fly, and
only one to veil their faces, while they are full of eyes behind,
and before, looking forth unveiled.&nbsp; All the worshippers
under the Gospel, look with open face&mdash;without a veil, and
on an unveiled object.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have here, evidently, only the rudiments of a sermon, but a
very fine one, a very suggestive one.&nbsp; To most minds, the
Bible has, probably, been, as Thomas Carlyle, or Jean Paul, would
express it, &ldquo;an eyeless socket, without the
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christmas Evans was expressing, in this very
suggestive sermon, the thoughts of some men whose words, and
works he had probably never met with; as George Herbert says
it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In
ev&rsquo;ry thing<br />
Thy words do find me out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond any other book,&rdquo; says Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, &ldquo;the Bible <i>finds</i> me;&rdquo; while John
Keble, in the &ldquo;Christian Year,&rdquo;&mdash;probably
written about the same time, when Christmas Evans was preparing
his sermon,&mdash;was employing the very same image in some of
his most impressive words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Eye of God&rsquo;s Word</i>!
where&rsquo;er we turn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever upon us! thy keen gaze<br />
<a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>Can all
the depths of sin discern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unravel every bosom&rsquo;s maze:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, that has felt thy glance of dread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrill through his heart&rsquo;s remotest cells,<br
/>
About his path, about his bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can doubt what Spirit in thee dwells?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following extract, we have a more sustained passage,
very fresh, and noble:&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Their Works do Follow
them</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In this world, every man receives according
to his faith; in the world to come, every man shall receive
according to his works.&nbsp; &lsquo;Blessed are the dead who die
in the Lord, for they rest from their labours, and their works do
follow them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Their works do not go <i>before</i>
them, to divide the river of Jordan, and open the gates of
heaven.&nbsp; This is done by their faith.&nbsp; But their works
are left behind, as if done up in a packet, on this side of the
river.&nbsp; John saw the great white throne, descending for
judgment, the Son of man sitting thereon, and all nations
gathered before Him.&nbsp; He is dividing the righteous from the
wicked, as the shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats.&nbsp;
The wicked are set on the left hand&mdash;&lsquo;Depart from me,
ye accursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and
his angels!&rsquo;&nbsp; But the righteous are placed on the
right hand, to hear the joyful welcome&mdash;&lsquo;Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world!&rsquo;&nbsp; The books are opened,
and Mercy presents the packets that were left on the other side
of Jordan.&nbsp; They are all opened, and the books are read,
wherein all their acts of benevolence are recorded.&nbsp; Justice
examines the several packets, and answers&mdash;&lsquo;All
right.&nbsp; Here they are.&nbsp; Thus it is
written&mdash;&ldquo;I was hungry, and ye gave Me meat; I was
thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me
in; I <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>was naked, and ye clothed Me; I was in prison, and ye
came unto Me!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; The righteous look upon each
other, with wonder, and answer&mdash;&lsquo;Those packets must
belong to others.&nbsp; We know nothing of all that.&nbsp; We
recollect the wormwood, and the gall.&nbsp; We recollect the
strait gate, the narrow way, and the slough of despond.&nbsp; We
recollect the heavy burden, that pressed so hard upon us, and how
it fell from our shoulders, at the sight of the cross.&nbsp; We
recollect the time, when the eyes of our minds were opened, to
behold the evil of sin, the depravity of our hearts, and the
excellency of our Redeemer.&nbsp; We recollect the time when our
stubborn wills were subdued, in the day of His power, so that we
were enabled both to will, and to do, of His good pleasure.&nbsp;
We recollect the time, when we obtained hope in the merit of
Christ, and felt the efficacy of His blood, applied to our hearts
by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; And we shall never forget the time,
when we first experienced the love of God, shed abroad in our
hearts.&nbsp; Oh, how sweetly, and powerfully it constrained us
to love Him, His cause, and His ordinances!&nbsp; How we panted
after communion, and fellowship with Him, as the hart panteth
after the water-brooks!&nbsp; All this, and a thousand other
things, are as fresh in our memory as ever.&nbsp; But we
recollect nothing of those bundles of good works.&nbsp; Where was
it?&nbsp; Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, and fed Thee; or
thirsty, and gave Thee drink; or a stranger, and took Thee in; or
naked, and clothed Thee?&nbsp; We have no more recollection, than
the dead, of ever having visited Thee in prison, or ministered to
Thee in sickness.&nbsp; Surely, those bundles cannot belong to
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mercy replies&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, verily, they
belong to you; for your names are upon them; and, besides, they
have not been out of my hands since you left them on the stormy
banks of Jordan.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the King
answers&mdash;&lsquo;Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done
it unto Me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the righteous do not know their own good works; if
<a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>they do
not recognize, in the sheaves which they reap at the
resurrection, the seed which they have sown, in tears, on
earth,&mdash;they, certainly, cannot make these things the
foundation of their hopes of heaven.&nbsp; Christ is their sole
dependence, for acceptance with God, in time, and in
eternity.&nbsp; Christ, crucified, is the great object of their
faith, and the centre of their affections; and, while their love
to Him prompts them to live soberly, and righteously, and godly,
in this present evil world, they cordially exclaim, &lsquo;Not
unto us, not unto us, but to Thy name, O Lord, give
glory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In leaving Anglesea behind him, the sufferings, and
contradictions he had known there, did not quench his
enthusiastic holiness, and fervent ardour.&nbsp; We are assured
of this when we read his</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Second Covenant with
God</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While returning from a place called
Tongwynl&acirc;s, over Caerphilly Mountain, the spirit of prayer
descended, very copiously, upon me.&nbsp; I wept for some hours,
and heartily supplicated Jesus Christ, for the blessings here
following.&nbsp; I found, at this time, a particular nearness to
Christ, as if He were close by me, and my mind was filled with
strong confidence that He attended to my requests, for the sake
of the merits of His own name.&nbsp; This decided me in favour of
Cardiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I.&nbsp; Grant me the great favour of being led by
Thee, according to Thy will&mdash;by the directions of Thy
providence, and Word, and this disposing of my own mind, by Thy
Spirit, for the sake of Thine infinitely precious blood.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;II.&nbsp; Grant, if I am to leave Caerphilly, that the
gale (of the Spirit&rsquo;s influence), and religious revival I
had there, may follow me to Cardiff, for the sake of Thy great
name.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;III.&nbsp; Grant Thy blessing upon bitter
things, to brighten, and quicken me, more and more, and not to
depress, and make me more lifeless.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IV.&nbsp; Suffer me not to be trodden under the proud
feet of members, or deacons, for the sake of Thy goodness.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;V.&nbsp; Grant me the invaluable favour of being, in
Thy hand, the means of calling sinners unto Thyself, and of
edifying Thy saints, wherever Thou wilt send me, for the sake of
Thy name.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;VI.&nbsp; If I am to stay at Caerphilly, give me some
tokens, as to Gideon of old, by removing the things that
discourage me, and are in the way of the prosperity of religion,
in that church.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;VII.&nbsp; Grant, Lord of glory, and Head of Thy
Church, that the Ark of the cause which is Thine, in Anglesea,
and Caerphilly, may be sustained from falling into the hands of
the Philistines.&nbsp; Do not reject it.&nbsp; Aid it speedily,
and lift up the light of Thy countenance upon it; and by Thy
Spirit, Word, and providence, so operate, as to carry things
forward in the churches, and neighbourhoods, in such a manner as
will produce changes in officers, and measures, that will
accomplish a thorough improvement, in the great cause, for the
establishment of which, in the world, Thou hast died,&mdash;and
by scattering those that delight in war, and closing the mouths
of those that occasion confusion.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;VIII.&nbsp; Grant me way-tokens, by the time I begin my
journey to Liverpool, and from thence to Anglesea, if it is Thy
will that I should go thither this year.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C.
E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IX.&nbsp; Oh, grant me succour, beneath the shadow of
the sympathy that is in Thee, towards them who are tempted, and
the unbounded power there is in Thee, to be the relief of
such.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X.&nbsp; Accept of my thanksgiving, a hundred millions
of times, that Thou hast not hitherto cast me from Thine hand, as
a <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>darkened star, or a vessel in which there is no
pleasure; and suffer not my life to be extended beyond my
usefulness.&nbsp; Thanks that Thou hast not given me a prey to
the teeth of any.&nbsp; Blessed be Thy name.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C.
E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;XI.&nbsp; For the sake of Thine infinite merit, do not
cast me, Thy servant, under the feet of pride, and injustice, of
<i>worldly</i> greatness, riches, and selfish oppression of any
men, but hide me in the secret of Thy tabernacle, from the strife
of tongues.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;XII.&nbsp; Help me to wait silently, and patiently upon
Thee, for the fulfilment of these things, and not become enraged,
angry, and speak unadvisedly with my lips, like Moses, the
servant of the Lord.&nbsp; Sustain my heart from sinking, to wait
for fresh strength from Zion.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;XIII.&nbsp; Help me to wait upon Thee, for the
necessaries of life; let Thy mercy, and goodness follow me, while
I live; and, as it hath pleased Thee to honour me greatly, by the
blessing Thou hast vouchsafed upon the ministry through me, as an
humble instrument, at Caerphilly, after the great storm had
beaten upon me in Anglesea, like Job, grant that this honour may
continue to follow me the remainder of my days, as Thou didst
unto Thy servant Job.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;XIV.&nbsp; Let this covenant abide, like the covenant
of salt, until I come to Thee, in the world of eternal
light.&nbsp; I entreat aid to resign myself to Thee, and to Thy
will.&nbsp; I beseech Thee, take my heart, and inscribe upon it a
deep reverence of Thyself, with an inscription, that time, and
eternity cannot efface.&nbsp; Oh, let the remainder of my sermons
be taken, by Thee, from my lips; and those which I write, let
them be unto Thee for a praise.&nbsp; Unto Thee I dedicate
them.&nbsp; If there should be anything, in them, conducive to
Thy glory, and to the service of Thy kingdom, do Thou preserve
it, and reveal it unto men; else, let it die, like the drops of a
bucket in the midst of the scorching heat of Africa.&nbsp; Oh,
grant that there may be a drop of that water, which Thou, alone,
canst impart, and which springs up to eternal life, <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>running
through all my sermons.&nbsp; In this covenant, which, probably,
is the last that will be written between me and Thee, on the
earth, I commit myself, my wife, and the churches amongst whom I
have preached, to the protection of Thy grace, and the care of
Thy covenant.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;XV.&nbsp; Let this covenant continue, when I am in
sickness, or in health, or in any other circumstance; for Thou
hast overcome the world, fulfilled the law, finished justifying
righteousness, and hast swallowed up death, in victory, and all
power, in heaven and earth, is in Thy hand.&nbsp; For the sake of
Thy most precious blood, and perfect righteousness, note this
covenant, with Thine own blood, in the court of the memorials of
forgiving mercy: attach unto it Thy name, in which I believe; and
here I, this day, set my unworthy name unto it, with my mortal
hand.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Christmas
Evans</span>.&nbsp; Dated Cardiff, April 24th, 1829.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This document, found among his papers, after death, contains
many affecting words, which give an insight to painful
experiences, and sufferings.&nbsp; The standard set by Christmas
Evans, was very high; his expectations from the Christian
profession were such as to give, to his ideas of the pastoral
office, perhaps somewhat of a stern aspect; nor can we forget
that all his life had been passed in a very severe school.&nbsp;
He was, perhaps, disposed to insist somewhat strenuously upon
Church discipline.&nbsp; No doubt, his years at Caerphilly were
among the happiest, and most unvexed in Church relations; his
ministerial power, and success were very great; still, as the
covenant we have just recited hints, there were probabilities of
removal to Cardiff.</p>
<p>The appearance of Christmas Evans in Caerphilly was regarded,
as we have seen, as something like an <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>advent, and, to him, it was, for a
short time, a haven of pleasant rest.&nbsp; There were some
eminent ministers, men of considerable knowledge, and real power,
residing in the neighbourhood, with whom he appears to have had
most pleasant intercourse; among others, a Mr. J. P. Davies, in
his way a mighty theologian, and clear, and ready expositor; he
was laid by, for some months, under medical care, at Caerphilly,
but was able to attend the ministry of the old preacher every
Sabbath, and became one of his most intimate friends; they met
almost daily, and the younger man was astonished by the
elder&rsquo;s insatiable thirst for knowledge, and equally
astonished by the extensive, and varied, stores of information he
had accumulated, in his busy, and incessantly toilsome
career.&nbsp; He acknowledged, afterwards, with delight, the
variety of lights he had received, both as to the construction of
a text, or the clearer definition of a principle, from his aged
friend.&nbsp; As to the preaching, he said it gave him quite a
new impression of the order of the preacher&rsquo;s mind: he
expected flashes of eloquence, brilliant pictures,&mdash;of these
he had long heard,&mdash;but what astonished him, was the
fulness, and variety of matter, Sabbath after Sabbath.&nbsp; Mr.
Davies only returned home to die; but he delighted his people,
when he returned, by repeatedly describing the comfort, and light
he had received, from the company of the matured, the aged, and
noble man.</p>
<p>The society he enjoyed was, probably, more cultivated, small
as was the village, than that by which he had been surrounded in
Anglesea; from all the inhabitants, and from the neighbourhood,
he received marks of great respect; it was, probably, felt,
generally, <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>that, by some singular turn of affairs, a great man, a
national man, a man of the Principality, had settled in their
midst.&nbsp; And he always after, and when he had left,
remembered this brief period of his life with deep
gratitude.&nbsp; He was more able to borrow books: here, for the
first time, he read a work, which was regarded as a mighty book
in that day, Dr. Pye Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scripture Testimony to
the Messiah;&rdquo; he read it with intense eagerness,
incorporating many of its valuable criticisms into his sermons,
and, especially, making them the subjects of ordinary
conversation.&nbsp; Rhys Stephen says, &ldquo;I remember
listening to him with wonder, when, in conversation with Mr.
Saunders, of Merthyr, he gave the substance of Dr. Pye
Smith&rsquo;s criticism on John xvii. 3.&nbsp; And I distinctly
remember, that when Mr. Evans said, &lsquo;Mr. Saunders, you will
observe that, on these grounds, the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
here mentioned, is the same knowledge as that of the only true
God, and that the knowledge of the former is as necessary to
salvation, as the knowledge of the latter&mdash;indeed, they are
one, and the same thing,&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; was the
reply; &lsquo;capital, very excellent.&nbsp; I never heard that
interpretation before.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was then a youth, and was
not astonished by the interpretation, which, of course, was new
to me, so much as by the admissions of the aged men that it was
new to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; At any rate, it illustrates the avidity
with which this mind still pursued the rays of light, from book
to book, from conversation to conversation.</p>
<p>On another occasion, he met a young minister at Llantrissant,
and, after a meeting in the morning, he inquired of the young man
what he was then reading; <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>the reply was, that he was going
slowly through Beattie on Truth a second time.&nbsp; Christmas
Evans immediately replied, &ldquo;You must come to see me before
you return to Swansea, and give me the substance of Beattie: was
he not the man that replied to David Hume, eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
young man said he had the book in his pocket, and that he would
cheerfully give it him, but the print was very small.&nbsp; He,
with still greater eagerness, said, &ldquo;I can manage
that.&nbsp; I will take of it, with many thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was a pleasure to give it him, and he pocketed it with as much
pleasure as ever a school-boy did the first prize, at the end of
the session.&nbsp; In three days after, the young man called upon
him, at his own house, and spent a couple of hours with him; but
he says he could get no farther, in conversation, than upon
Beattie,&mdash;he was thoroughly absorbed in the argument with
Hume, and his school of scepticism, and unbelief.&nbsp; Yet he
was now sixty-five years of age; his one eye was very weak,
though seeing well enough, without a glass, at the proper
distance; and he was, otherwise, full of bodily infirmities; but
his love of reading was unabated, as was, also, his earnest
curiosity to know what was passing on in the world of
thought.</p>
<p>And among his friends, at this period, we notice some members
of the Edwards family,&mdash;David Edwards, of Beaupre, or, as it
is commonly pronounced, Bewper, in Glamorganshire; and Evan
Edwards, of Caerphilly, the son, and grandson of one of the most
remarkable men modern Wales has produced, William Edwards, in his
day a mighty engineer.&nbsp; Until his time, the Rialto, in
Venice, was esteemed the largest arch in <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Europe, but
he threw an arch over the Taff forty-two feet wider, and thus,
for a long time, it held its reputation of being the largest arch
in the world.&nbsp; A wonderful man was William Edwards, entirely
self-made, not only a great engineer, but a successful farmer,
and an ordained Independent minister.&nbsp; He was wealthy, of
course, but he insisted upon receiving a good income from his
church, although he distributed every farthing among the poor of
his own neighbourhood, and added, considerably, to the sum he
distributed, from his own property.&nbsp; The successor to Mr.
Edwards, as the pastor of the Independent Church of Y-Groeswen,
was the Rev. Griffith Hughes, a person of about the same age as
Christmas Evans, also, although a polished gentleman, a
self-taught man, a wit, a man of considerable reading, and
information, and widely advanced in his religious opinions;
although, professedly, a Calvinist, beyond the narrow, and
technical Calvinism of his time, and even beyond the Fullerism,
or doctrines of Andrew Fuller, which had been charged on
Christmas Evans, as a crime, by his enemies in Anglesea.</p>
<p>It was about this time that he was earnestly entreated to
prepare a volume of sermons for publication, and it seemed to be
in connection with this, and with some fears, and discouragements
which still troubled his mind, that he made the following entry,
discovered among his papers after his death:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Order things so, O Lord, that they may not
prove a hindrance, and a discouragement to me, and an obstacle to
the progress of Thy cause.&nbsp; Thy power is infinite, and Thy
wisdom infallible.&nbsp; Stand between me, and all strife, that
no <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>evil
effect may fall upon me.&nbsp; I flee under the shadow of Thy
wings to hide myself, as the chickens do under the wings of the
hen.&nbsp; Let nothing corrupt, and extinguish my gifts, my zeal,
my prosperity; let nothing hinder the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been earnestly requested, by many of my brethren
in the ministry, to prepare some of my sermons for the
press.&nbsp; In Anglesea, I had no leisure for such work,
although I once commenced it, and wrote out five for the
purpose.&nbsp; I let the work rest for two years, at Caerphilly;
but, here, my mind has been moved towards it anew; and now I come
to Thee, O Lord, who art the Head of the Church, and the chief
Prophet and Teacher of the Church, to consult Thee, whether I
shall proceed with the work, or not.&nbsp; Is it a part of my
duty, or a foolish device of my own?&nbsp; I beseech, for Thy
name&rsquo;s sake, Thy gracious guidance herein.&nbsp; Permit me
not to labour, with my weak eyesight, at a work that Thou wilt
not deign to bless, but that shall be buried in
oblivion,&mdash;unless it may please Thee (for Thou hast the keys
of the house of David), in Thy providence, to prepare my way to
publish the work, without danger to myself, of debt, and
disgrace; and unless it may please Thee, the great Shepherd of
the sheep, to guide me, to give forth the true Gospel, not only
without error, but with the savour, and unction that pervade the
works of Bunyan, and the hymns of William Williams; and, also,
may they prove for the edification of Thy Church, and the
conversion of sinners!&nbsp; If Thou wilt condescend to take the
work under Thy care, help me to accomplish the design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reading the 91st Psalm, I perceive that he who
dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty; and that is so safe a place, and so
impenetrable a protection, that the arrow that flieth by day, and
the pestilence that walketh in darkness, with the sting of the
serpent, the asp, and the viper, cannot hurt or injure him who
hath made it his refuge.&nbsp; It is by faith, I hope, that I
have gathered together all my jewels, <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>and placed them under the shadow of
safety that is in God.&nbsp; I have given my name anew to Christ,
my body, my talents, my facility in preaching,&mdash;my name, and
character as a man, a Christian, and as a preacher of the Gospel;
my time, the remainder of my preaching services, my success, my
wife, and all my friends, and helpers in the cause of the Lord,
for whom I earnestly pray that they may be blessed in Anglesea,
Caernarvonshire, Caerphilly, Cardiff, and all the churches in
Wales, many of which have helped me in my day.&rdquo;</p>

Last Sermon&mdash;Dying&mdash;Last
Words&mdash;&ldquo;Good-bye!&nbsp; Drive on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last field of the great, good man&rsquo;s pastorate was
Caernarvon; thither he removed when about sixty-seven years of
age.&nbsp; It might be thought, that after such a hard, and
exhausting life of travel, and toil, some plan might have been
devised, by which his last days should be passed in restfulness,
and peace; but it was not to be so: throughout his life, his had
been up-hill work, no path of roses, no easy way; and, indeed, we
usually know that such spheres are reserved for men who can carry
nothing with them but the weight of dignified dulness.&nbsp; Of
every sphere, from his first settlement at Lleyn, we read, that
the cause was in a prostrate condition; and so, here, Christmas
Evans appears to have been invited to take the charge of the
Caernarvon church because it consisted of about thirty members,
chiefly <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>of the lowest class, of course quarrelling, and
disunited.&nbsp; The dissolution of the church was advised.&nbsp;
There was a fairly respectable place of worship, but it was
&pound;800 in debt, apparently, to us, in these days, not a very
large sum, but a sum of considerable importance in Wales, and
especially in that day.</p>
<p>So the question was discussed at a ministerial association,
and some brother minister present, delivered himself of a
confirmatory dream he had had on the subject, and the matter was
practically settled, when a young minister spoke up, in the
conference, and said to the venerable man, &ldquo;Yes, you had
better go to Caernarvon: it is not likely your talents would
suit, but you might do excellently well at
Caernarvon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The impudent speech astounded all the
ministers present, except the unfortunate utterer of it.&nbsp;
They knew not what to say.&nbsp; After a pause, the brethren all
struck utterly dumb, Christmas Evans opened his one large eye
upon his adviser, and, with some indignation, he said, &ldquo;Ay,
where hast thou come from?&nbsp; How long is it since thou didst
chip thy shell?&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, it was the very word: no one
else could have, in so summary a manner, crunched up the thin
egg-shell of pretentious conceit.</p>
<p>There was a real desire, on the part of the trustees of
Caernarvon, and of English friends in Liverpool, that he should
return to the north; and some gentlemen facilitated his return by
giving him a gig, so that he might travel at his ease, and in his
own way.&nbsp; This was not a very great donation, but it added,
materially, to his comfort: he was able to travel pleasantly, and
conveniently with Mrs. Evans.&nbsp; <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>His horse, Jack, had been his
companion for twenty years, but the pair were very fond of one
another.&nbsp; Jack knew, from a distance, the tones of his
master&rsquo;s voice; and Christmas, on their journeys, would
hold long conversations with Jack.&nbsp; The horse opened his
ears the moment his master began to speak, made a kind of
neighing, when the rider said, as he often did, &ldquo;Jack,
<i>bach</i>, we have only to cross one low mountain again, and
there will be capital oats, excellent water, and a warm
stable,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>So he bade farewell to Cardiff in 1832, and upon the following
Sunday, after his farewell there, he appears to have commenced
his new ministry.&nbsp; It seems pathetic to us, to think of the
old man, but we have no idea that he had any such pity, or
sympathy for himself.&nbsp; Who can doubt, either, that he
favoured, and hailed the opportunity of the return to the north?
and Caernarvon, and Anglesea were almost one: he had but to cross
the Menai Straits to be again in Anglesea&mdash;Anglesea, the
scene of so many trials, and triumphs, where he had planted so
many churches, sustained so many spiritual conflicts, and
enjoyed, in his Cildwrn cottage, no doubt, years of much domestic
happiness.&nbsp; It seems to us he ought never to have left
Anglesea; but he regarded his exile to Caerphilly as a mission,
that was to terminate, if success should crown it.&nbsp; And so
he was back again in the old neighbourhood, and it appears, that
the announcement of his return created universal delight, and
joy, and strong excitement.&nbsp; He had been absent for about
seven years, and the people, on account of his advanced age, when
leaving them, expected to see him bowed with infirmity, and <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>his
preaching power, they supposed, would rather affectingly remind
them of what he had been.</p>
<p>Shortly after his entrance upon the work of Caernarvon, a
public occasion presented itself for his appearance in
Anglesea.&nbsp; The whole neighbourhood flocked out, to see the
patriarch.&nbsp; As he appeared on the platform, or
preaching-place, in the open-air,&mdash;for no chapel could have
contained the multitude,&mdash;the people said, &ldquo;Why, he
does not seem at all older! he looks more like a man of
forty-five, than sixty-five, or sixty-six.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his
preaching was just the same, or, possibly, even richer, and
greater: it was his own old self, their own old Christmas Evans;
the same rich, and excursive fancy, the same energetic, and fiery
delivery.&nbsp; The appearance of such a man, under such
circumstances,&mdash;one who has worn well, borne the burden and
heat of the day, and taken his part &ldquo;on the high places of
the field,&rdquo;&mdash;is a mighty awakening, and heart-healing
time for old believers, who find their love to each other renewed
in the rekindled love to the old pastor, and father in
Christ.&nbsp; Old memories very tenderly touch reciprocating
hearts.&nbsp; The old words, and the old voice, awaken old
emotions, which now have become new.&nbsp; But, then, it is only
a minister with a heart, who can touch this well-spring of
feeling: starched respectability will not do it, eminent
collegiate learning will not do it, rolling rhetorical periods
will not do it.&nbsp; It is only the great hearts who can open
these sluices of feeling, these fountains of emotion, in which
the past, and the present mingle together, as the hearers drink
refreshing streams from the fountains of recollection.</p>
<p><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>While
in Caernarvon, he penned in his journal the following pious
reflections:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been thinking of the great goodness
of the Lord unto me, throughout my unworthy ministry; and now, in
my old age, I see the work prospering wonderfully in my hand, so
that there is reason to think that I am, in some degree, a
blessing to the Church, when I might have been a burden to it, or
rather a curse, by which one might have been induced to wish me
laid in the earth, that I might no longer prevent the progress of
the work.&nbsp; Thanks be to God, that it is not so! though I
deserve no better, yet I am in the land of mercy.&nbsp; This is
unto me, according to the manner of God unto His people.&nbsp; My
path in the valley, the dangers, and the precipices of
destruction upon which I have stood, rush into my thoughts, and
also the sinking of many in death, and the downfall of others by
immorality, and their burial in Kibroth-Hattaavah, the graves of
inordinate desire; together with the withering, the feebleness,
and the unfruitfulness of some, through the influence of a secret
departure from God, and of walking in the hidden paths, that lead
to apostasy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here we may most appropriately insert a very
characteristic letter, which shows the exceedingly stringent
ideas which Christmas Evans entertained with regard to Church
membership,&mdash;strait ideas, which, we suppose, would be

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Letter to a Brother Minister on
Church Discipline</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Beloved
Brother</span>,&mdash;I write to you, August 5th, 1836, in the
seventieth year of my age, and in the fiftieth of my ministry,
after conversing much with ministerial brethren, <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>earnestly
desiring to see our Associational Union brought into action, by
representatives of the churches, with a view to promote a
determination,&mdash;1.&nbsp; To bear each other&rsquo;s burden
more efficiently, in the denomination to which we belong.&nbsp; I
lament the deficiency in this point, and ardently wish to see it
effectually remedied.&nbsp; 2. To watch over and promote a holy
conversation among all the members, and all the preachers, in a
more efficient manner, to prevent persons of unbecoming
conversation from obtaining privileges, in any church, when they
have been excluded in another; for that would occasion blots, and
blemishes to appear on the bright countenance of the
ministry.&nbsp; The Associational Union, in which all the
churches of the same faith, and order join, should be a defence
of the independence of the churches, through their
representatives: it should also operate as a sort of check upon
independency, lest it should become opposed to the general good,
and frustrate the co-operation of the whole body.&nbsp; <i>That
they may all be one</i>, is the motto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respecting Church discipline.&nbsp; We cannot be
certain that we are doing right, by administering the same
punishment to all offenders, even for the same offence; for the
general character weighs heavily, in the balance of
discipline.&nbsp; Also, a distinction should be made between the
seducer, and the seduced; and between being overcome, or falling
into sin, and living habitually in sin, and following it, as a
slave following his master.&nbsp; The denial of Peter, from
weakness, and without previous deliberation, was very different
from the betrayal of Judas, and his intentional selling of
Christ.&nbsp; The different characters of Saul, king of Israel,
and that of David, required different treatment, in discipline,
on account of their offences.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s discipline
upon Saul was that of a rod of iron, but upon David, the
correcting rod of a Father, for his good, that he might be a
partaker of His holiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things, brother, which we ought to avoid
<a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>in the
exercise of discipline: 1, we should avoid too great severity on
the one part; and, 2, too much leniency on the other part.&nbsp;
Wisdom is necessary here to distinguish the different
characters,&mdash;those who require severity, and those who claim
tenderness: the two are to be found blended in the principle of
evangelical discipline.&nbsp; A difference is to be made betwixt
some, who may have been companions in the same crime; snatching
some of them as brands from the burning.&nbsp; The ground of the
distinction lies in the different amount of guilt, which subsists
between the seducer, and seduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have witnessed danger, and have sustained some harm
myself, and seen harm done in churches, by exercising tenderness
towards some persons, in the vain hope of their
reformation.&nbsp; Receiving verbal testimony, or mere fluent
acknowledgments, from their lips, without waiting for fruit, in
action, also; some having been often accused; and as often
turning to the refuges frequented by them.&nbsp; I never
exercised tenderness towards such as these, without being repaid
by them afterwards, if they had opportunity: Shimei-like, they
would curse me, after I had shed the best oil of tenderness on
their heads.&nbsp; There are some in the Christian Church like
Jezebel; and there are some in our congregations like Joab, the
son of Zeruiah, that you can scarce discipline them without
rending the kingdom, until they become ripe for judgment; for
they hardly ever repent, more than did Joab and Shimei: they are
ultimately suddenly broken, without any danger to the Church from
their fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive that the Scriptures make a difference
between one that falls into sin, and one wallowing in it; between
one overtaken by a party of marauders, and dragged into the camp,
and made drunk at supper, and one, like Judas, going to the
party, and being secretly one of them, having pistols as they
had: such are hypocrites.&nbsp; I have many times been the
advocate of the fallen, and in a variety of instances have
observed this operating beneficially for the Church.&nbsp;
Sometimes <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>I have found those who had been spared upon their own
verbal contrition, blessing God for His long forbearance of them,
and also their spiritual brethren, who had in a manner set their
bones; as the Scripture hath it, &lsquo;Restore such an one in
the spirit of meekness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be careful that discretion, and love, be in
exercise, though in strife, and contention it be not always an
easy matter to do this.&nbsp; When the beasts of dissension get
loose from the caravan, Satan sometimes drives them through the
streets of Zion, that they may enter the houses of the
inhabitants; and like the lioness that escaped from the keepers
at Shrewsbury, and attacked the foremost horse in the carriage,
so contentions frequently attack the leaders, in order to stop
the carriage of the ministry as it travels on, in the labours of
the pulpit.&nbsp; In the midst of the noise of strife, the man of
God must raise his voice to heaven for courage, and tenderness,
so that the oil of Christ&rsquo;s love to the souls of men may be
found in the oil-flagon of reproof, which is poured on the head;
for if anger, and revenge enter in, they will drop, like the
spider in Germany, into the pot, and that will prevent the
salutary effect of the oil, because the poison of wrath is mixed
with it.&nbsp; The righteousness of God cannot be fulfilled in
this manner in the discipline.&nbsp; Oh, brother! who is
sufficient for these things, without constant help from
heaven?&nbsp; How awful is this place!&nbsp; This is the house of
God, and the gate of heaven; and here is a ladder, by which we
may climb up for help, and a school, in which we may learn how to
conduct ourselves in the house of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot but be conscious, brother, of the great
difficulty there is not to speak unadvisedly with our lips, as
did Moses, whilst drawing water for the rebellious
Israelites.&nbsp; The rebellion of the people had embittered his
spirit, so that his obduracy stood like a cloud between the
people, and the tenderness of the Lord, when He was showing mercy
upon them by giving them water.&nbsp; Moses <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>upbraided
their rebellion instead of showing mercy, as the dispensation of
God now required; a dispensation which contained in it a secret
intimation of the great mercy to be shown by the death of Christ
on the cross.&nbsp; Their strife was the cause of embittering the
spirit of Moses, yet he should have possessed his soul in
patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things, brother, which you should
observe.&nbsp; First, you will be called upon to attend to causes
of contention; and you will find persons so hardened, that you
will not be able to obtain weapons, in all the armoury of
God&rsquo;s Word, that will terrify them, and make them afraid of
entering their old haunts.&nbsp; Such are persons without faith,
and without the fear of God, and the love of Christ influencing
their minds; and though you warn them of the consequences of
their contentions, that they are likely to deprive them of the
privileges of the house of God, and thus forfeit the promised
land, yet they stand unmoved, nothing terrified, for they value
the flesh-pots of Egypt, and their livelihood there, more than
the manna, and the land of promise.&nbsp; You cannot frighten
them by speaking of the danger, and loss of the immunities of the
Church below, or that above.&nbsp; Esau-like, they will sell
their birthright, as Christian professors, for a mess of
pottage.&nbsp; A man who has no money is not afraid to meet with
robbers in the wood; but he who has gold to lose will be
cautious, and watchful, lest he should be robbed of his
property.&nbsp; On a night of great storm, when ships are broken
to pieces, and sinking, a person who has no share in any of them
will not tremble, or feel any concern on their account.&nbsp;
Thus there are some men, concerning whom it is impossible to make
them dread going out among the rapacious beasts of backslidings,
and no storms can keep them in fear.&nbsp; Their spirit is one
with the marauders, and they have no care, for they have nothing
to lose in the tempests that blow upon the cause of the religion
of Christ.&nbsp; These are the tares, or the children of the
wicked one, in the Church.</p>
<p><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>&ldquo;Secondly, for your own encouragement, brother, I
remark that you will have to attend to the exercise of
discipline, and to treat with persons that may be alarmed, and
made to tremble at the Word of God, and not rush on
presumptuously in their evil course.&nbsp; These are professors,
who possess white garments, and the gold of faith, and eye-salve
from the unction of the Holy One.&nbsp; These individuals are
rich in faith.&nbsp; They are afraid of revolutions, and
upsettings of the constitutional order of the new covenant, for
they have funds invested in the stocks of God&rsquo;s
kingdom.&nbsp; They are afraid that any storm, or rock of offence
should come in the way of the Gospel ship, for their treasure is
on board it, and they have an interest in it.&nbsp; They dread
the thought of walking unwatchfully, and licentiously, lest they
should be robbed of their riches, and forfeit the fellowship of
God in prayer, lose the light of His countenance, and His peace
in the means of grace, and lest they should be deprived of their
confidence in the merits of Christ, and a good conscience.&nbsp;
They have denied themselves, and have pulled out the right eye,
lest they should not be acceptable before God.&nbsp; They dread
harbouring in their bosoms the old guilt and former doubts.&nbsp;
They are cautious not to give a night&rsquo;s lodging to such
miscreants as anger, revenge, lust, and things which are of the
earth; for they know that these are robbers, and if they have any
indulgence they will steal away the <i>title-deeds</i> of
assurance to the inheritance.&nbsp; They are well aware, also,
that they will sustain the loss of a pure conscience, which has
been purged by the blood of Christ, and which, as a golden chest,
is a preserver of our confidence, immovable unto the end.&nbsp;
It is possible, brother, to manage, and discipline such
professors.&nbsp; They have something to lose, consequently they
will not flee from their refuge, lest they should be
destroyed.&nbsp; <i>Keep that which thou hast</i>.&nbsp; David
lost for a season the enjoyment of the above blessings; but he
was cleansed with hyssop, had his spirit renewed, and his riches
were restored to him by faith&rsquo;s <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>view of the Messiah, for which he
vowed to sing aloud for ever, and ever.&nbsp; He prayed, after
this, to be delivered from presumptuous sins, lest he should be
imprisoned a second time by a party so wicked, and
detestable.&nbsp; May the spiritual gift be kindled in you,
brother.&nbsp; Grace be with you, for ever, and ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Affectionately,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Christmas Evans</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caernarvon</i>, <i>August</i> 5<i>th</i>,
1836.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it was hard work in Caernarvon.&nbsp; The debt upon the
chapel was a perpetually-recurring trouble.&nbsp; We have said
when he went there eight hundred pounds was the burden, and that
the people were very poor.&nbsp; Of this eight hundred, four
hundred seems to have been collected by a Mr. John Edwards, who
used, as his introduction, in asking for contributions, the
specimen of Welsh eloquence to which we have referred (The
Graveyard World); so that Christmas Evans may, really, be
regarded as the liquidator of the debt to that extent.&nbsp; The
time came when the whole remaining sum had to be paid.&nbsp; What
could be done?&nbsp; Over seventy years of age, the old man
started forth, on a tour through the south, to attempt to raise
the sum.&nbsp; In April, 1838, when he had been four years in
Caernarvon, he set off with his wife, and a young preacher, the
Rev. John Hughes.&nbsp; Before he set out, he wrote a circular to
his brethren, which was published in the <i>Welsh
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; It is scarcely possible, we think, to read
it, remembering who wrote it, and the circumstances under which
it was written, without tears of feeling:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Brethren</span>,&mdash;We have received notice to pay up <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>three
hundred pounds.&nbsp; The term of the lease of life has expired
in my case, even threescore and ten years, and I am very much
afflicted.&nbsp; I have purposed to sacrifice myself to this
object, though I am afraid I shall die on the journey&rdquo; (he
did die on his journey); &ldquo;and I fear I shall not succeed in
my errand for Christ.&nbsp; We have no source to which we can now
repair, but our own denomination in Wales, and brethren, and
friends of other communities, that may sympathize with us.&nbsp;
Oh, brethren, pray, with me, for protection on the
journey&mdash;for strength, and health this <i>once</i>, on
occasion of my bidding farewell to you all! pray for the light of
the Lord&rsquo;s countenance upon me in preaching; pray for His
own glory, and that His key may open the hearts of the people, to
contribute towards His cause in its present exigency.&nbsp; Oh,
help us, brethren!&mdash;when you see the old brother, after
having been fifty-three years in the ministry, now, instead of
being in the grave with his colleagues, or resting at home with
three of them who are yet alive&mdash;brethren Lewis of
Llanwenarth, Davies of Velin Voel, and Thomas of
Aberduar,&mdash;when you see him coming, with the furrows of
death in his countenance, the flowers of the grave on his head,
and his whole constitution gradually dissolving; having laboured
fifty years in the ministry in the Baptist denomination.&nbsp; He
comes to you with hundreds of prayers, bubbling, as it were, from
the fountain of his heart, and with a mixture of fear, and
confidence.&nbsp; Oh, do not frown upon him!&mdash;he is afraid
of your frowns.&nbsp; Smile upon him, by contributing to his
cause, this once for all.&nbsp; If you frown upon me, ministers
and deacons, by intimating an <i>irregular case</i>, I am afraid
I shall sink into the grave before returning home.&nbsp; This is
my last sacrifice for the Redeemer&rsquo;s cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, wherever he passed along, he was received by all
the churches, and throughout every county, with more than
cordiality&mdash;with great joy.&nbsp; <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>He was very
successful in raising money for the purpose which urged him forth
from home: perhaps his popularity was never so great as
now.&nbsp; Mr. Cross, one of his biographers, says, that wherever
he preached, the place was thronged at an early hour, and,
frequently, multitudes remained outside, unable to obtain
admittance.&nbsp; He reached Monmouthshire, and preached before
the County Association; and it is said, that the sermon evinced
all his vigour of intellect, and splendour of genius, and as
perfect a command over the feelings of the great audience as
ever.&nbsp; One of his great images here was his description of
the Gospel, on the day of Pentecost, as a great electrical
machine, Christ turning the handle, Peter placing the chain in
contact with the people, and the Holy Ghost descending like a
stream of ethereal fire, and melting the hearts of three thousand
at once.&nbsp; His text was, &ldquo;By grace ye are
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the effort was too much for him, and he was laid up for a
week at the house of Mr. Thomas Griffith, a kind host, who, with
his whole family, attempted, in every way, to minister to his
comfort, and, with affectionate assiduity, sought to restore
him.&nbsp; On the whole, he appears to have been full of vivacity
that week, and, during the intervals of pain, cheered, and
charmed his friends.&nbsp; He had, one day, come downstairs, and
Mr. James, the son-in-law of his host, was helping him up
again.&nbsp; He had only got a few steps, when he said buoyantly,
&ldquo;Mr. James, I dare say if I thought the French were behind
me with their bayonets, I should be able to get upstairs without
your help.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the word he took his arm <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>from Mr.
James&rsquo;s shoulder, and briskly ran up the flight of steps,
laughing at his feat.</p>
<p>His conversation was, however, usually brightly
religious.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the Gospel,&rdquo; he said once
in the course of talk&mdash;&ldquo;This is the Gospel: &lsquo;He
that believeth shall be saved.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, in order to the
truth of this declaration, every believer must be saved.&nbsp;
If, in the last day, the great enemy find one single soul not
saved, who ever believed the Gospel, he would take that soul up,
present that soul to the Judge, and to the immense assembly, and
say, &lsquo;The Gospel is not true.&rsquo;&nbsp; He would take
that lost believer through all the regions of pandemonium, and
exhibit him in triumph to the devils, and the
damned.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said his host,
&ldquo;that shall never be, Mr. Evans.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, planting the forefinger of his right
hand on his knee, as was his wont, and exclaiming, in a tone of
triumphant congratulation, &ldquo;<i>Never</i>! <i>never</i>!
<i>never</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the house of Mr. Griffith, of Tredegar, he proceeded
on his way, preaching at Caerphilly, Cardiff, Cowbridge,
Bridgend, and Neath, and he reached Swansea on Saturday, July
14th.&nbsp; The next day, Sunday, he preached
twice&mdash;preached like a seraph, says one of his memorialists:
in the morning his subject was the Prodigal Son; the evening,
&ldquo;I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was the guest of Daniel Davies, the pastor of the Welsh Baptist
Church in the town, the blind preacher, as he was called, a man
of great celebrity, and unquestioned power.&nbsp; He was to be
the last host of his greater brother, or rather father, in the
ministry.&nbsp; On the Monday evening, he went <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>out to tea,
with a friend who was always glad to greet him, Mr. David
Walters; and on the same evening he preached, in English, in
Mount Pleasant Chapel: his text was, &ldquo;Beginning at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was very feeble,&mdash;perhaps we need
scarcely wonder at that, after the two services of the day
before.&nbsp; He always felt a difficulty when preaching in
English, and, upon this occasion, he seemed much tried; gleams,
and flashes of his ordinary brilliancy there were, as in the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning at Jerusalem!&nbsp; Why at Jerusalem?&nbsp;
The Apostles were to begin there, because its inhabitants had
been witness to the life, and death of Christ; there He had
preached, wrought miracles, been crucified, and rose again.&nbsp;
Here, on the very spot of His deepest degradation, He was also to
be exalted: He had been crucified as a malefactor, He was now to
be elevated in the same place as a King; here were accorded to
Him the first-fruits of His resurrection.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
the strain of the sermon:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;At Jerusalem,
Lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Lord,
these are the men who crucified Thee; we are not to preach it to
<i>them</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, preach it to
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;To the man who plaited the crown of
thorns, and placed it on Thy Head?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes; tell
him that from My degradation he may obtain a crown of
glory.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose we meet the very man that
nailed Thy hands and feet to the cross, the very man that pierced
Thy side, that spat in Thy face?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Preach the
Gospel to them all: tell them all that I am the Saviour; that all
are welcome to participate in the blessings of My salvation; I am
the same Lord over all, and rich unto all that call <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>on
Me.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were some of the most characteristic
passages.&nbsp; As he was coming down the pulpit stairs, he said,
loud enough to be heard by many present, &ldquo;<i>This is my
last sermon</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was even so.&nbsp; He was taken very ill during the
night; the next day he was worse, the next day worse still, and
then medical assistance was called in.&nbsp; But on the Thursday,
he got up, and walked for some time in the garden.&nbsp; It seems
doubtful whether he thought that his end was so near, although he
had a dream, in one of the early evenings in the week, in which
he seemed to come up to a great river, which he did not then
cross, so that he scarcely thought his work or life might be over
even yet.</p>
<p>But on Thursday night he was worse again, and on Friday
morning, at two o&rsquo;clock, he said to his friends, Mr.
Davies, Mr. Hughes, and others round his bed, &ldquo;I am leaving
you.&nbsp; I have laboured in the sanctuary fifty-three years,
and this is my comfort, that I have never laboured without blood
in the basin,&rdquo;&mdash;the ruling power of imagination strong
in him to the close, evidently meaning that he had never failed
to preach Christ and Him crucified.&nbsp; A few more remarks of
the same character: &ldquo;Preach Christ to the people,
brethren.&nbsp; Look at me: in myself I am nothing but ruin, but
in Christ I am heaven, and salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He repeated a
verse from a favourite Welsh hymn, and then, as if he had done
with earth, he waved his hand, and exclaimed, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Good-bye</span>!&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Drive
on</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems another instance of the labour of life pervading by
its master-idea the hour of death.&nbsp; For <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>how many
years the &ldquo;one-eyed man&rdquo; of Anglesea had gone to, and
fro on his humble nag!&nbsp; As we have seen, lately his friends
had given him a gig, that he might be more at ease in his
Master&rsquo;s service; still he had his old horse, companion of
his many journeys.&nbsp; While he was dying, the old mountain
days of travel came over his memory&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Good-bye</span>!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Drive on</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned over, and
seemed to sleep.&nbsp; He slept indeed.&nbsp; His friends tried
to rouse him, but the angelic postman had obeyed the
order,&mdash;the chariot had passed over the everlasting
hills.&nbsp; So he died, July 19th, 1838, in the seventy-third
year of his age, and fifty-fourth of his ministry.</p>
<p>His funeral took place four days after his death, in the
burying-ground attached to the Welsh Baptist Chapel, in
Swansea.&nbsp; It is said there never was such a funeral in
Swansea, such a concourse, and crowd of mourners, weeping their
way to the grave, and following, as it had been their
father.&nbsp; Fountains of sorrow were everywhere unsealed
throughout the Principality, in Anglesea especially, where he had
passed the greater portion of his life; indeed, throughout the
Principality, there was scarcely a pulpit, of the order to which
he belonged, which was not draped in black; and it was evident
that all felt &ldquo;a prince and a great man had fallen in
Israel.&rdquo;</p>

Remarks on what was called &ldquo;Welsh Jumping&rdquo; in
Religious Services.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> character of Christmas Evans,
it will be seen, from all that has gone before, appears to us to
be eminently interesting as the most distinct, to us the most
central, and realizable figure, in the religious life of his
country, and his times: he is the central figure in a group of
remarkable men.&nbsp; We shall not discuss the question as to
whether he was the greatest,&mdash;greatness is so relative a
term; he appears, to us, certainly, from our point of view, the
most representative Welsh preacher of his time, perhaps of any
time: in him seemed embodied not merely the imaginative, but the
fanciful, the parable-loving spirit of his department of the
great Celtic family; with this, that ardent devotion, that
supersensuous absorption, <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>which to our colder temperament
looks like superstition.</p>
<p>One writer finely remarks of him, and with considerable truth,
so far as his own country is concerned, &ldquo;He is a connecting
link between the beginning and the ending of the eighteenth
century; he has the light, the talent, and the taste of the
beginning, and has received every new light that has appeared
since.&nbsp; He was enabled to accompany the career of religious
knowledge in the morning, and also to follow its rapid strides in
the evening.&nbsp; In this he is unlike every other preacher of
the day: the morning and evening light of this wonderful century
meet in him; he had strength to climb up to the top of Carmel in
the morning, and remain there during the heat of the day, and see
the consuming sacrifice, and the licking up of the water; his
strength continued, by the hand of the Lord, so that he could
descend from the mount in the evening, and run without fainting
before the king&rsquo;s chariot to Jezreel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, there is considerable truth in these words,
although author and reader may alike take exception to some of
them.&nbsp; The circumstances and situation of the life of this
singular man have been set so clearly before the reader in these
pages, that there can be no difficulty in apprehending the
unpropitious and unfavourable atmosphere through which he was
compelled to move.&nbsp; Few men can ever have more richly
deserved the epithet of self-made: no systematic tuition could he
ever have received; near to manhood before he even attempted to
obtain, before he had even presented to him any inducements to
attempt, the most rudimental elements of knowledge; <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>we cannot
gather that he had any teachers, who assisted him with more than
hints, or the loan of a grammar, a lexicon, or some volume he
desired to read; there are no indications of any particular
kindness, no friendly hands, no wicket, or gate of school, or
college opened to him.&nbsp; And as with the commencement of his
career, so with its course; his intercourse was, probably, mostly
with men, and minds inferior to his own; books, we have seen, he
had few, although he read, with avidity, wherever he could
borrow; and as with his mental training, so with his spiritual
experience,&mdash;it appears all to have gone on within himself,
very much unrelieved, and unaided; he had to fight his own
doubts, and to gather strength in the wrestling, and the
conflict.&nbsp; And as he thus formed himself, without
assistance, so, apparently without any human assistance, he
continued to labour on, amidst the popular acclamations of
fame.&nbsp; The absence of all, and every exhibition of
gratitude, is peculiarly affecting.&nbsp; Altogether, this
strikes us as a grand, self-sustained, and much-enduring life,
always hard, and necessitous; but its lines are very indelible,
written as with a pen of iron, and as with the point of a
diamond.&nbsp; It is natural that, in his old age, he should
speak thus to a young man of the&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Value of Industry</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am an old man, my dear boy, and you are
just entering the ministry.&nbsp; Let me now, and here tell you
one thing, and I commend it to your attention, and memory.&nbsp;
All the ministers that I have ever known, who have fallen into
disgrace, or into uselessness, <i>have been idle men</i>.&nbsp; I
never am much afraid of a young minister, when I ascertain that
<a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>he can,
and does, <i>fairly sit down to his book</i>.&nbsp; There is Mr.
&mdash;, of whom we were talking just now, a man of such unhappy
temper, and who has loved, for many years, to meddle in all sorts
of religious disputes and divisions.&nbsp; He would have, long
ago, been utterly wrecked, had not his habits of industry saved
him.&nbsp; He has stuck to his book, and that has kept him from
many dishonours, which, had he been an idle man, must have, by
this time, overwhelmed him.&nbsp; An idle man is in the way of
every temptation; temptation has no need to seek him; <i>he is at
the corner of the street</i>, <i>ready</i>, <i>and waiting for
it</i>.&nbsp; In the case of a minister of the Gospel, this peril
is multiplied by his position, his neglected duties, the
temptations peculiar to his condition, and his own superior
susceptibility.&nbsp; <i>Remember this&mdash;stick to your
book</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foundations of the good man&rsquo;s character were laid in
honest simplicity, real, and perfect sincerity; he was innocent,
and unsuspecting as a child, and here, no doubt, lay the cause of
many of his trials; his frank, and confiding disposition became
the means by which his own peace was poisoned, when jealous men,
malicious men,&mdash;and these sometimes Christian
men,&mdash;took advantage of his simplicity.&nbsp; He once
employed a person to sell a horse for him at a fair; after some
time, Evans being there, he went out to see if the man was likely
to succeed.&nbsp; He found that a bargain was going on for the
horse, and nearly completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your horse, Mr. Evans?&rdquo; said the
purchaser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his age, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&ldquo;But this man tells me he is only
fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly twenty-three, for he has been with me
these twenty years, and he was three years old when I bought
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he safe-footed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is very far from that, and, indeed, that is
the reason why I want to part with him; and he has never been put
into harness since I bought him either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go into the house, Mr. Evans, and stop
there,&rdquo; said the man whom he had employed to make the sale:
&ldquo;I never shall dispose of the horse while you are
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dealer was, in this instance, mistaken, for the frank
manner in which Mr. Evans had answered the questions, and told
the truth, induced the buyer to make the purchase, even at a very
handsome price.&nbsp; But the anecdote got abroad, and it added
to Mr. Evans&rsquo;s reputation, and good name; and even the
mention of the story in these pages, after these long years have
passed away, is more to his memory than the gold would have been
to his pocket.</p>
<p>Like all such natures, however, he was not wanting in
shrewdness, and we have seen that, when irritated, he could
express himself in sharp sarcasm.&nbsp; He had this power, but,
upon principle, he kept it under control.&nbsp; It was a saying
of his, &ldquo;It is better to keep sarcasms pocketed, if we
cannot use them without wounding friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, two
ministers of different sects were disputing upon some altogether
trifling, and most immaterial point of ecclesiastical
discipline.&nbsp; One of them said, &ldquo;What is your opinion,
Mr. Evans?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;To-day I saw two boys
quarrelling <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>over two snails: one of them insisted that his snail
was the best, because it had horns; while the other as
strenuously insisted that his was the best, because it had
none.&nbsp; The boys were very angry, and vociferous, but the two
snails were very good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He comes before us with all that strength of character which
he unquestionably possessed, as a spirit most affectionate, and
especially forgiving.&nbsp; An anecdote goes about of a
controversy he had with a minister of another sect, who so far
forgot himself as to indulge in language utterly inconsistent
with all Christian courtesy.&nbsp; But a short time elapsed, when
the minister was charged with a crime: had he been convicted,
degradation from the ministry must have been the smallest part of
his punishment, but his innocence was made manifest, and
perfectly clear.&nbsp; Mr. Evans always believed the charge to be
false, and the attempt to prosecute to be unjust, and merely
malicious.&nbsp; On the day when the trial came on he went, as
was his wont, in all matters where he was deeply interested, into
his own room, and fervently prayed that his old foe might be
sustained, and cleared.&nbsp; He was in company with several
friends and brother ministers, when a minister entered the room,
and said, &ldquo;Mr. B&mdash; is fully acquitted.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Evans instantly fell on his knees, and with tears exclaimed,
&ldquo;Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, for delivering one of
Thy servants from the mouth of the lions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
very soon joined his hearty congratulations with those of the
other friends of the persecuted man.</p>
<p>It is certain the story of the Church recites very few
instances of such an active life, so eminently <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>devotional,
and prayerful: we have seen this already illustrated in those
remarkable covenants we have quoted.&nbsp; He had an
old-fashioned faith in prayer.&nbsp; He was very likely never
troubled much about the philosophy of it: his life passed in the
practice of it.&nbsp; No Catholic monk or nun kept more regularly
the hours, the matins, or the vigils than he.&nbsp; It appears,
that for many years he was accustomed to retire for a short
season, for prayer, three times during the day, and to rise at
midnight, regularly, for the same purpose.&nbsp; He suffered much
frequently from slander; he had disorders, and troubles in his
churches; he had many afflictions, as we have seen, in life, and
the frequent sense of poverty; but these all appeared to drive
this great, good man to prayer, and his friends knew it, and felt
it, and felt the serenity, and elevation of his character when in
the social circle, even when it was also known that heavy trials
were upon him.&nbsp; And one who appears to have known him
applies to him, in such moments, the language of the Psalmist,
&ldquo;All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia, out of
the ivory palaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, perhaps, in this connection, we may say, without being
misunderstood, that the especial necessities of his life gave to
it something of a cloistered, and monastic character.&nbsp; He
was not immured in the cell, or the monastery, but how little can
we realize the profound solitude of those long journeys, so
constantly renewed, through the silence of the lonely hills,
across the desolation of the uninhabited moor!&nbsp; An intensely
nervous, and meditative nature, no possibility of the book then,
no retreat, we can believe no desire to retreat from the infinite
<a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>stretched above him, and even the infinite seeming to
spread all around him.&nbsp; In so devout a nature, how
calculated all this to foster devotion, until it became at once
the support, as well as the passion, of the soul!</p>
<p>And these perpetual wanderings among the mountains must have
been a fine spiritual education, an education deepening emotion
in the soul, and at the same time kindling the mind in thoughtful
imagery.&nbsp; He reminds us of Dean Milman&rsquo;s hero, also a
pilgrim through Wales:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His path is &rsquo;mid the Cambrian
mountains wild;<br />
The many fountains that well wandering down<br />
Plinlimmon&rsquo;s huge round side their murmurs smooth<br />
Float round him; Idris, that like warrior old<br />
His batter&rsquo;d and fantastic helmet rears,<br />
Scattering the elements&rsquo; wrath, frowns o&rsquo;er his
way,<br />
A broad irregular duskiness.&nbsp; Aloof<br />
Snowdon, the triple-headed giant, soars,<br />
Clouds rolling half-way down his rugged sides.<br />
Slow as he trod amid their dizzy heights,<br />
Their silences and dimly mingling sounds,<br />
Rushing of torrents, war of prison&rsquo;d winds;<br />
O&rsquo;er all his wounded soul flow&rsquo;d strength, and
pride,<br />
And hardihood; again his front soar&rsquo;d up<br />
To commerce with the skies, and frank and bold,<br />
His majesty of step his rugged path<br />
Imprinted . . .<br />
. . .&nbsp; Whence, ye mountains, whence<br />
The spirit that within your secret caves<br />
Holds kindred with man&rsquo;s soul?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry Vaughan delighted to call himself the Silurist, always
proud of the country from whence he came: his was a different
region of Wales from that which produced Christmas Evans.&nbsp;
Henry Vaughan <a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>was the swan of the Usk; but the sermons of Evans, like
the sacred poems of Vaughan, were a kind of <i>Silex
Scintillans</i>, or sparks from the flint, sparks shot forth from
the great mountains, and the overhanging stars, with both of
which he held long communion: he had no opportunity for any other
often in the course of his travel; they were as the streets of
God, lighted with suns stretching across his way, in the green
amphitheatre of day, and the blue amphitheatre of night.</p>
<p>And this was, no doubt, very greatly the secret of his
preaching.&nbsp; It is not too strong a term to use, to say that,
with all its brilliancy, its bardic, and poetic splendours, it
was massive preaching.&nbsp; He usually laid the foundations of
the edifice of a sermon, strong and secure in reason, and in
Scripture, securing the understanding, and the convictions of his
hearers, before he sketched those splendid allegories, or gave
those descriptive touches; before even he appealed to those
feelings, when he led the whole congregation captive by the
chains of his eloquence.</p>
<p>We have said before, that like most of the preachers of his
country, he delighted also in the use of sharp, rememberable
sayings.&nbsp; That is a striking expression when he says,
speaking of death, to the believer in Christ, &ldquo;The
crocodile of death shall be harnessed to the chariot of the
daughter of Zion, to bring her home to her father&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;Our immortal souls, although in
perishable bodies, are evidently originally birds of Paradise,
and our faculties are the beautiful wings by which we understand,
remember, fear, believe, love, hope, and delight in immortal, and
eternal things.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is very pretty <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>when he
says, &ldquo;Faith is the wedding-ring by which the poor daughter
of the old Ammonite is married to the Prince of Peace: she is
raised from poverty to opulence, from degradation to honour, not
because of the intrinsic value of the ring, though it is a golden
one, but on account of the union which it signifies, between her,
and the beloved Prince.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;A cradle, a
cross, and a grave, all of His Father&rsquo;s appointing, must
Jesus have, in order to open a fountain of living water to the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such sentences as these the reader will find
strewn along all his sermons, and many such in those which we
have quoted more at length.</p>
<p>But it must always be remembered that Christmas Evans was, in
a pre-eminent degree, the orator.&nbsp; He had a presence; he was
nearly six feet high, and finely-proportioned; his whole bearing
was dignified, and majestic; he had but one eye, it is true, but
we can believe the testimony which describes it as singularly
penetrating, and even burning with a wonderful effect, when the
strong inspiration of his eloquence was upon him.&nbsp; Then his
voice was one of marvellous compass, and melody; like his sermons
themselves, which were able to touch the hearts of mighty
multitudes, so his voice was able to reach their ears.</p>
<p>When he heard Robert Hall, the marvellous enchantment of that
still, small voice, a kind of soprano in its sweet, and cleaving
clearness, so overwhelmed him, that he longed to preach in that
tone, and key; but the voices of the men were fitted to their
words,&mdash;Hall&rsquo;s to his own exquisitely-finished
culture, and to the sustained, and elevated culture either of
spirit, or intelligence of those whom he addressed; <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>Evans&rsquo;s words we suppose rolled like the thunder
of a mighty sea, with all its amplitude of many-voiced
waves.&nbsp; Singers differ, and, no doubt, while we are able to
admire the evangelical force, and fervour, and even the fine
pictorial imagery of the sermons of Christmas Evans, it is
something like looking at the painting on the glass, which may be
very pretty, and exquisite, but in order really to see it, it
should be in the camera, with the magnifying lens, and the
burning lamp behind it.&nbsp; Alas! it is so with all reported
and written eloquence: the figures, and the words are almost as
cold as the paper upon which they are printed, as they pass
before the eye; they need the inspiration of the burning genius,
and that inspired by a Divine affection, or afflatus, in their
utterance, to give them a real effect.</p>
<p>And in the case of Christmas Evans&rsquo;s sermons, this is
not all: to us they are only translations,&mdash;translations
from the difficult Welsh language,&mdash;translations without the
wonderful atmospheric accent of the Welsh vowel; so that the very
best translation of one of Christmas Evans&rsquo;s performances
can only be the skeleton of a sermon.&nbsp; We may admire the
structure, the architecture of the edifice, but we can form
little idea of the words which were said to have set Wales on
fire.</p>
<p>We recur to the expression we used a few sentences
since.&nbsp; We are able to appreciate the massive character of
these sermons: it is very true they are cyclopean,&mdash;they
have about them a prim&aelig;val rudeness; but then the cyclopean
architecture, although primitive, is massive.&nbsp; Here are huge
thoughts, hewn out of the prim&aelig;val, but ever-abiding
instincts of our <a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>nature, or, which is much the same thing, from the
ancient, and granite flooring of the Divine Word.&nbsp; We must
make this allowance for our preacher: he took up his testimony
from the grand initial letters of Faith; he knew something of the
other side of thought; the belief of his country, in his time, in
the earlier days of his ministry, had been very much vexed by
Sabellianism.</p>
<p>The age of systematic, and scientific doubt had not set in on
the Principality; but he met the conscience of man as a
conscience, as that which was a trouble, and a sorrow to the
thoughtful mind, and where it was still untroubled, he sought to
alarm it, and awaken it to terror, and to fear; and he preached
the life, and work of Christ as a legitimate satisfaction, and
rest to the troubled conscience.&nbsp; This was, no doubt, the
great burden of his ministry; these are the subjects of all his
sermons.&nbsp; He used the old words, the old nomenclature.</p>
<p>Since the day of Christmas Evans, theological language is so
altered, that the theological lexicon of the eighteenth century
would seem very poorly to represent theological ideas in this
close of the nineteenth.&nbsp; But we have often thought, that,
perhaps, could the men of that time be brought face to face with
the men of this, it might be found that terms had rather enlarged
their signification, than essentially altered their
meaning,&mdash;this in many instances, of course, not in
all.&nbsp; But it would often happen, could we but patiently
analyze the meaning of theological terms, we should often find a
brother where we had suspected an alien, and a friend where we
had imagined a foe.</p>
<p><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>Thus
Christmas Evans dealt with great truths.&nbsp; He was a wise
master-builder, and all the several parts of his sermons were
related together in mutual dependence.&nbsp; The reader will
notice that there was always symmetry in their construction: he
obeys an order of thought; we feel that he speaks of that which,
to the measure of the revelation given, and his entrance into the
mind of the Spirit, he distinctly understands.&nbsp; A mind,
which itself lives in the light, will, by its own sincerity, make
the subject which it attempts to expound clear; and he had this
faculty, eminently, of making abstruse truths shine out with
luminous, and distinct beauty.&nbsp; This is always most noble
when the mind of a preacher rises to the highest truths in the
Christian scheme.&nbsp; A great deal of our preaching, in the
present day, well deserves the name of pretty: how many men,
whose volumes of sermons are upon our shelves, both in England,
and America, seem as if their preachers had been students in the
natural history of religion, gathering shells, pretty rose-tinted
shells, or leaves, and insects for a theological museum!&nbsp;
And a very pretty occupation, too, to call attention to the
lily-work of the temple.&nbsp; But there are others, whose aim
has been&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rather to see great
truths<br />
Than touch and handle little ones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, certainly, Christmas Evans was of that order who occupied
the mind, and single eye, rather on the pathway of the planet
beyond him, than in the study of the most exquisite shell on the
sea-shore.&nbsp; Among religious students, and even among eminent
<a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>preachers, there are some, who may be spoken of as
Divine, and spiritual astronomers,&mdash;they study the laws of
the celestial lights; and there are others, who may be called
religious entomologists,&mdash;they find themselves at home
amidst insectile prettinesses.&nbsp; Some minds are equal to the
infinitely large, and the infinitely small, the remote not more
than the near; but such instances are very rare.</p>
<p>The power of great truths overwhelms the man who feels them;
this gives rise to that impassioned earnestness which enables a
great speaker to storm, and take possession of the hearts of his
hearers: the man, it has been truly said, was lost in his theme,
and art, was swallowed up in excited feeling, like a whirlpool,
bearing along the speaker, and his hearers with him, on the
current of the strong discourse.&nbsp; The histories of the
greatest orators,&mdash;for instance, Massillon, Bossuet, and
Robert Hall,&mdash;show how frequently it was the case, that the
excited feelings of an audience manifested themselves by the
audience starting from their seats, and, sometimes, by loud
expressions of acclamation, or approbation.&nbsp; Some such
scenes appear to have manifested themselves, even beneath
Christmas Evans&rsquo;s ministry.&nbsp; Some such scenes as these
led to the report of those excitements in Wales, which many of
our readers have heard of as &ldquo;Welsh jumping.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Evans appears to have been disposed to vindicate from absurdity
this phenomenon,&mdash;the term used to describe it was, no
doubt, employed as a term of contempt.&nbsp; He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Common preaching will not do to arouse
sluggish districts from the heavy slumbers into which they have
sunk; <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>indeed, formal prayers, and lifeless sermons are like
bulwarks raised against these things: five, or six stanzas will
be sung as dry as Gilboa, instead of one, or two verses, like a
new song full of God, of Christ, and the Spirit of grace, until
the heart is attuned for worship.&nbsp; The burying grounds are
kept in fine order in Glamorganshire, and green shrubs, and herbs
grow on the graves; but all this is of little value, for the
inhabitants of them are all dead.&nbsp; So, in every form of
godliness, where its power is not felt, order without life is
exceedingly worthless: you exhibit all the character of human
nature, leaving every bud of the flower to open in the beams of
the sun, except in Divine worship.&nbsp; On other occasions, you
English appear to have as much fire in your affections as the
Welsh have, if you are noticed.&nbsp; In a court of law, the most
efficient advocate, such as Erskine, will give to you the
greatest satisfaction; but you are contented with a preacher
speaking so lifelessly, and so low, that you can hardly
understand a third part of what he says, and you will call this
decency in the sanctuary.&nbsp; To-morrow I shall see you
answering fully to the human character in your own actions.&nbsp;
When the speakers on the platform will be urging the claims of
missions, you will then beat the boards, and manifest so much
life, and cheerfulness that not one of you will be seen to take
up a note-book, nor any other book, while the speaker shall be
addressing you.&nbsp; A Welshman might suppose, by hearing your
noise, that he had been silently conveyed to one of the meetings
of the Welsh jumpers, with this difference, that you would
perceive many more tears shed, and hear many more &lsquo;calves
of the lips&rsquo; offered up, in the rejoicing meetings of
Wales; but you use your heels well on such occasions, and a
little of your tongues; but if even in Wales, in certain
places,&mdash;that is, places where the fervent gales are not
enjoyed which fill persons with fear, and terror, and joy, in
approaching the altar of God,&mdash;you may see, while hearing a
sermon, one looking into his hymn-book, another into his
note-book, and <a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>a third turning over the leaves of his Bible, as if he
were going to study a sermon in the sanctuary, instead of
attending to what is spoken by the preacher as the mouth of
God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He proceeds, at considerable length, in this strain, in a tone
of apology which, while it is frank, and ingenuous, certainly
seems to divest the excitement of the Welsh services of those
objectionable features which, through a haze of ignorant
prejudice, had very much misrepresented the character of such
gatherings in England.&nbsp; It was, as Mr. Evans shows, the
stir, and excitement, the more stereotyped acclamation, of an
English meeting manifesting itself in the devotional services of
these wild mountain solitudes.&nbsp; He continues,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is an exceedingly easy matter for a
minister to manage a congregation while Christian enjoyment keeps
them near to God; they are diligent, and zealous, and ready for
every good work; but it is very easy to offend this joyous
spirit&mdash;or give it what name you please, enthusiasm,
religious madness, or Welsh jumping,&mdash;its English
name,&mdash;and make it hide itself; a quarrel, and disagreement
in the Church, will occasion it to withdraw immediately;
indulging in sin, in word or deed, will soon put it to flight: it
is like unto the angel formerly, who could not behold the sin of
Israel without hiding himself,&mdash;so is the angel of the
religious life of Wales, which proves him to be a holy angel,
though he has the name of a Welsh jumper.&nbsp; My prayer is,
that this angel be a guard upon every congregation, and that none
should do anything to offend him.&nbsp; It is an exceedingly
powerful assistant to accompany us through the wilderness, but
the individual that has not felt its happy influences has nothing
to lose; hence he does not dread a dry meeting, and a hard
prayer, for they are all the same to him; but the <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>people of
this enjoyment pray before prayer, and before hearing, that they
may meet with God in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seasons when these blessings are vouchsafed to the
churches of Wales are to be noticed: it is generally at a time
when the cause of religion is at a low ebb, all gone to slumber;
this happy spirit of enjoyment in religion, like the angel of the
pillar of fire, appears when there is distress, and everything at
the worst; its approach to the congregation is like the glory of
God returning to the temple of old; it creates a stir among the
brethren; they have a new prayer, and a new spirit given them to
worship God; this will lay hold of another; some new strength,
and light will appear in the pulpit, until it will be imagined
that the preacher&rsquo;s voice is altered, and that his spirit
has become more evangelical, and that he preaches with a more
excellent savour than usual; tenderness will descend upon the
members, and it will be seen that Mr. Wet-eyes, and Mr. Amen,
have taken their place among them; the heavenly gale will reach
some of the old backsliders, and they are brought, with weeping,
to seek their forfeited privilege; by this time the sound of
Almighty God will be heard in the outer court, beginning to move
the hearers like a mighty wind shaking the forest; and as the
gale blows upon the outer court, upon the hearers, and the young
people, and afterwards making its way through the outer court, to
rouse the inner court, until a great concern is awakened for the
state of the soul.&nbsp; And, see, how these powerful revivals
evince their nature: they are certain, where they are strong, to
bend the oaks of Bashan, men of strong, and sturdy minds, and
haughty hearts; they bring all the ships of Tarshish, and the
merchants of this world, in the harbour hearing; the power of the
day of the Lord will raze all the walls of bigotry to the
foundation; thoughts of eternal realities, and the spirit of
worship, are by these blessings diffused abroad, and family
worship is established in scores of families; the door of such a
district, opened by the powers of the world to come, creates the
channel where <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>the living waters flow, and dead fish are made alive by
its virtues.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Christmas Evans vindicated the excitements of religious
services in Wales from English aspersions.</p>

<i>SUMMARY OF GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CHRISTMAS EVANS AS A
PREACHER</i>.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Remarks renewed in Vindication of his Use of

Translation&mdash;Closing Remarks on his Place and Claim to
Affectionate Regard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the extracts we have already
given, it will be seen that Christmas Evans excelled in the use
of parable in the pulpit.&nbsp; Sometimes he wrought his mine
like a very Bunyan, and we believe no published accounts of these
sermons in Welsh, and certainly none that we have found
translated into English, give any idea of his power.&nbsp; With
what amazing effect some of his sermons would tell on the vast
audiences which in these days gather together in London, and in
our great towns!&nbsp; This method of instruction is now usually
regarded as in <a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>bad taste; it does not seem to be sanctioned by the
great rulers, and masters of oratorical art.&nbsp; If a man could
create a &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; and recite it,
it would be found to be a very doubtful article by the rhetorical
sanhedrim.&nbsp; Yet our Lord used this very method, and without
using some such method&mdash;anecdote, or illustration&mdash;it
is doubtful whether any strong hold can be obtained over the
lower orders of mind.&nbsp; Our preacher entered into the spirit
of Scripture parable, and narrative.&nbsp; One of the most famous
of his discourses is that on the Demoniac of Gadara, which we
have already given in preceding pages.&nbsp; Some of our readers
will be shocked to know that, in the course of some of his
descriptions in it, he convulsed his audience with laughter in
the commencement.&nbsp; Well, he need not be imitated there; but
he held it sufficiently subdued before the close, and an
alternation of tears, and raptures, not only testified to his
powers, but to his skill in giving an allegorical reading of the
narrative.</p>
<p>For the purpose of producing effect,&mdash;and we mean, by
effect, visible results in crushed, and humbled hearts, and
transformed lives,&mdash;it would be a curious thing to try, in
England, the preaching of some of the great Welshman&rsquo;s
sermons.&nbsp; What would be the effect upon any audience of that
great picture of the Churchyard World, and the mighty controversy
of Justice, and Mercy?&nbsp; Let it be admitted that there are
some things in it, perhaps many, that it would not demand a
severe taste to expel from the picture, but take it as the broad,
bold painting of a man not highly educated,&mdash;indeed, highly
educated men, as we have said, could not <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>perform
such things: a highly-educated man could never have written the
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo;&mdash;let it be remembered
that it was delivered to men, perhaps, we should say, rather
educated than instructed, men illiterate in all things
<i>except</i> the Bible.&nbsp; We ourselves have, in some very
large congregations, tried the preaching of one of the most
famous of Evans&rsquo;s sermons, &ldquo;The Spirit walking in dry
places, seeking rest, and finding none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christmas Evans&rsquo;s preaching was by no means defective in
the bone, and muscle of thought, and pulpit arrangement; but, no
doubt, herein lay his great <i>forte</i>, and power,&mdash;he
could paint soul-subduing pictures.&nbsp; They were not pieces of
mere word-painting, they were bathed in emotion, they were
penetrated by deep knowledge of the human heart.&nbsp; He went
into the pulpit, mighty from lonely wrestlings with God in
mountain travellings; he went among his fellow-men, his
audiences, strong in his faith in the reality of those covenants
with God, whose history, and character we have already presented

<p>There was much in his preaching of that order which is so
mighty in speech, but which loses so much, or which seems to
acquire such additional coarseness, when it is presented to the
eye.&nbsp; Preachers now live too much in the presence of
published sermons, to be in the highest degree effective.&nbsp;
He who thinks of the printing-press cannot abandon himself.&nbsp;
He who uses his notes slavishly cannot abandon himself; and,
without abandonment, that is, forgetfulness, what is oratory?
what is action? what is passion?&nbsp; If we were asked what are
the <a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>two
greatest human aids to pulpit power, we should say,
Self-possession and Self-abandonment; the two are perfectly
compatible, and in the pulpit the one is never powerful without
the other.&nbsp; Knowledge, Belief, Preparation, these give
self-possession; and Earnestness, and Unconsciousness, these give
self-abandonment.&nbsp; The first, without the last, may make a
preacher like a stony pillar, covered with runes and
hieroglyphics; and the last, without the first, may make a mere
fanatic, with a torrent of speech, plunging lawlessly, and
disgracefully abroad.&nbsp; The two, in combination in a noble
man, and teacher, become sublime.&nbsp; Perhaps they reached
their highest realization, among us, in Robertson of
Brighton.&nbsp; In another, and in a different department, and
scarcely inferior order of mind, they were nobly realized in
Christmas Evans.</p>
<p>Perhaps there never was a time when ministers were more afraid
of their audiences than in this day; afraid of the big man, with
his wealth, afraid of the highly-cultured young man with the
speculative eyeglasses, who has finished his education in
Germany; afraid lest there should be the slightest departure from
the most perfect, and elegant taste.&nbsp; The fear of man has
brought a snare into the pulpit, and it has paralysed the
preacher.&nbsp; And in this highly-furnished, and cultivated time
we have few instances of preachers who, in the pulpit, can either
possess their souls, or abandon them to the truth, in the text
they have to announce.</p>
<p>It must have been, one thinks, a grand thing to have heard
Christmas Evans; the extracts from his journal, the story they
tell of his devout, and rapt <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>communions of soul with God, among
the mountains, the bare, and solitary hills, reveal sufficiently
how, in himself, the preacher was made.&nbsp; When he came into
the pulpit, his soul was kindled, and inflamed by the live coals
from the altar.&nbsp; Some men of his own country imitated him,
of course.&nbsp; Imitations are always ludicrous,&mdash;some of
these were especially so.&nbsp; There was, says one of his
biographers, the shrug, the shake of the head, the hurried,
undertoned exclamation, &ldquo;Bendigedig,&rdquo; etc., etc.,
always reminding us, by verifying it, of Dr. Parr&rsquo;s
description of the imitators of Johnson: &ldquo;They had the
nodosities of the oak without its vigour, and the contortions of
the sibyl without her inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not so with him: he had rare, highly spiritual, and
gifted sympathies; but even in his very colloquies in the pulpit,
there was a wing, and sweep of majesty.&nbsp; He preached often
amidst scenes of wildness, and beauty, in romantic dells, or on
mountain sides, and slopes, amidst the summer hush of crags, and
brooks, all ministering, it may be thought, to the impression of
the whole scene; or it was in rude, and unadorned mountain
chapels, altogether alien from the &aelig;sthetics so charming to
modern religious sensibilities; but he never lowered his tone,
his language was always intelligible; but both it, and the
imagery he employed, even when some circumstances gave to it a
homely light, and play, always ascended; he knew the workings of
the heart, and knew how to lay his finger impressively upon all
its movements, and every kind of sympathy attested his power.</p>
<p>It is a great thing to bear men&rsquo;s spirits along <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>through the
sublime reaches, and avenues of thought, and emotion; and
majesty, and sublimity seem to have been the common moods of his
mind; never was his speech, or his pulpit, like a Gilboa, on
which there was no dew.&nbsp; He gave it as his advice to a young
preacher, &ldquo;Never raise the voice while the heart is dry;
let the heart, and affections shout first,&mdash;let it commence
within.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man who could say, &ldquo;Hundreds of
prayers bubble from the fountain of my mind,&rdquo;&mdash;what
sort of preacher was he likely to make?&nbsp; He &ldquo;mused,
and the fire burned;&rdquo; like the smith who blows upon the
furnace, until the iron is red hot, and then strikes on the anvil
till the sparks fly all round him, so he preached.&nbsp; His
words, and thoughts became radiant with fire, and metaphor; they
flew forth rich, bright, glowing, like some rich metal in
ethereal flame.&nbsp; As we have said, it was the nature, and the
habit of his mind, to embody, and impersonate; attributes, and
qualities took the shape, and form of persons; he seemed to enter
mystic abodes, and not to talk of things as a metaphysician, or a
theologian, but as a spectator, or actor.&nbsp; The magnificences
of nature crowded round him, bowing in homage, as he selected
from them to adorn, or illustrate his theme; all things
beautiful, and splendid, all things fresh, and young, all things
old, and venerable.&nbsp; Reading his discourses, for instance,
the <i>Hind of the Morning</i>, we are astonished at the
prodigality, and the unity of the imagination, the coherency with
which the fancies range themselves, as gems, round some central
truth, drinking, and reflecting its corruscations.</p>
<p>Astounded were the people who heard; it was <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>minstrelsy
even more than oratory; the truths were old and common, there was
no fine discrimination, and subtle touch of expression, as in
Williams, and there was no personal majesty, and dignity of
sonorous swell of the pomp of words, as in John Elias; but it was
more,&mdash;it was the wing of prophecy, and poetry, it was the
rapture of the seer, or the bard; he called up image after image,
grouped them, made them speak, and testify; laden by grand, and
overwhelming feelings, he bore the people with him, through the
valley of the shadow of death, or across the Delectable
Mountains.&nbsp; There is a spell in thought, there is a spell in
felicitous language; but when to these are added the vision which
calls up sleeping terror, the imagination which makes living
nature yet more alive, and brings the solemn, or the dreadful
people of the Book of God to our home, and life of to-day, how
terribly majestic the preacher becomes!</p>
<p>The sermons of Christmas Evans can only be known through the
medium of translation.&nbsp; They, perhaps, do not suffer as most
translations suffer; but the rendering, in English, is feeble in
comparison with the at once nervous, bony, and muscular Welsh
language.&nbsp; The sermons, however, clearly reveal the man;
they reveal the fulness, and strength of his mind; they abound in
instructive thoughts; their building, and structure is always
good; and many of the passages, and even several of the sermons,
might be taken as models for strong, and effective pulpit
oratory.&nbsp; Like all the preachers of his day, and order of
mind, and peculiarity of theological sentiment, and training, his
usage of the imagery of Scripture was remarkably free; his use
also of texts <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>often was as significant, and suggestive as it was,
certainly, original.</p>
<p>No doubt, for the appreciation of his purpose, and his power
in its larger degree, he needed an audience well acquainted with
Scripture, and sympathetic, in an eminent manner, with the mind
of the preacher.&nbsp; There seem to have been periods, and
moments when his mind soared aloft, into some of the highest
fields of truth, and emotion.&nbsp; Yet his wing never seemed
little, or petty in its flight.&nbsp; There was the firmness, and
strength of the beat of a noble eagle.&nbsp; Some eloquence
sings, some sounds; in one we hear the voice of a bird hovering
in the air, in the other we listen to the thunder of the plume:
the eloquence of Christmas Evans was of the latter order.</p>
<p>We have remarked it before,&mdash;there is a singular
parable-loving instinct in Wales.&nbsp; Its most popular
traditional, and prose literature, is imbued with it; the
&ldquo;Mabinogion,&rdquo; the juvenile treasures of Welsh legend,
corresponding to the Grimm of Germany, and the other great
Teutonic and Norse legends, but wholly unlike them, prove
this.&nbsp; But we are told that the most grand prose work in
Wales, of modern date, and, at the same time, the most
pre-eminently popular, is the &ldquo;Sleeping Bard,&rdquo; by
Elis Wyn.&nbsp; He was a High Church clergyman, and wrote this
extraordinary allegory at the commencement of the last
century.&nbsp; Christmas Evans must have known it, have known it
well.&nbsp; It portrays a series of visions, and if Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s testimony may be relied upon, they are thoroughly
Dantesque.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;It is a singular mixture of the
sublime, and the coarse, the <a name="page330"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>terrible, and the ludicrous, of
religion, and levity, and combines Milton, Bunyan, and
Quevedo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is immense praise.&nbsp; The Vision of the World, the
first portion, leads the traveller down the streets of Pride,
Pleasure, and Lucre; but in the distance is a cross street,
little and mean, in comparison with the others, but clean, and
neat, and on a higher foundation than the other streets; it runs
upwards, towards the east; they sink downwards, towards the
north&mdash;this is the street True Religion.&nbsp; This is very
much in the style of Christmas Evans, and so also is the vision
of Death, the vision of Perdition, and the vision of Hell.&nbsp;
This singular poem appears to have been exceedingly popular in
Wales when Christmas Evans was young.</p>
<p>But our preacher has often been called the Bunyan of
Wales&mdash;the Bunyan of the pulpit.&nbsp; In some measure, the
epithet does designate him; he was a great master of parabolic
similitude, and comparison.&nbsp; This is a kind of preaching
ever eminently popular with the multitude; it requires rather a
redundancy of fancy, than imagination&mdash;perhaps a mind
considerably disciplined, and educated would be unable to indulge
in such exercises&mdash;a self-possession, balanced by ignorance
of many of the canons of taste, or utterly oblivious, and
careless of them; for this is a kind of teaching of which we hear
very little.&nbsp; Now we have not one preacher in England who
would, perhaps, dare to use, or who could use well, the parabolic
style.&nbsp; This was the especial power of Christmas
Evans.&nbsp; He excelled in personification; he would seem
frequently to have been mastered by this faculty.&nbsp; The
abstraction of thought, the disembodied phantoms <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>of another
world, came clothed in form, and feature, and colour; at his
bidding they came&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ghostly
shapes<br />
Met him at noontide; Fear, and trembling Hope,<br />
Silence, and Foresight; Death, the skeleton,<br />
And Time, the shadow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, he frequently astounded his congregations, not merely by
pouring round his subject the varied hues of light, or space, but
by giving to the eye defined shapes, and realizations.&nbsp; We
do not wonder to hear him say, &ldquo;If I only entered the
pulpit, I felt raised, as it were, to Paradise, above my
afflictions, until I forgot my adversity; yea, I felt my mountain
strong.&nbsp; I said to a brother once, &lsquo;Brother, the
doctrine, the confidence, and strength I feel, will make persons
dance with joy in some parts of Wales.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yea,
brother,&rsquo; said he, with tears flowing from his
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was visited by remarkable dreams.&nbsp;
Once, previous to a time of great refreshing, he
dreamt:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought he was in the church at Caerphilly, and
found many harps hanging round the pulpit, wrapped in coverings
of green.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I will take
down the harps of heaven in this place.&rsquo;&nbsp; In removing
the covering, he found the ark of the covenant, inscribed with
the name of Jehovah.&nbsp; Then he cried, &lsquo;Brethren, the
Lord has come to us, according to His promise, and in answer to
our prayers.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; In that very place, he shortly
afterwards had the satisfaction of receiving one hundred and
forty converts into the Church, as the fruit of his ministry.</p>
<p>As we have said, nothing can well illustrate, on paper, the
power of the orator&rsquo;s speech, but the following <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>may serve,
as, in some measure, illustrating his method:&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Gospel Mould</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I compare such preachers to a miner, who
should go to the quarry where he raised the ore, and, taking his
sledge in his hand, should endeavour to form bars of iron of the
ore in its rough state, without a furnace to melt it, or a
rolling mill to roll it out, or moulds to cast the metal, and
conform the casts to their patterns.&nbsp; The Gospel is like a
form, or mould, and sinners are to be melted, as it were, and
cast into it.&nbsp; &lsquo;But ye have obeyed from the heart that
form of doctrine which was delivered you,&rsquo; or into which
you were delivered, as is the marginal reading, so that your
hearts ran into the mould.&nbsp; Evangelical preachers have, in
the name of Christ, a mould, or form to cast the minds of men
into; as Solomon the vessels of the temple.&nbsp; The Sadducees
and Pharisees had their forms, and legal preachers have their
forms; but evangelical preachers should bring with them the
&lsquo;form of sound words,&rsquo; so that, if the hearers
believe, or are melted into it, Christ may be formed in their
hearts,&mdash;then they will be as born of the truth, and the
image of the truth will appear in their sentiments, and
experience, and in their conduct in the Church, in the family,
and in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Preachers without the mould are
all those who do not preach all the points of the Gospel of the
Grace of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now present several extracts, derived from a variety
of sources, happily illustrating the general character of his
sermons.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Saul of Tarsus and His Seven
Ships</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Saul of Tarsus was once a thriving merchant
and an extensive ship-owner; he had seven vessels of his own, the
<a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>names of
which were&mdash;1.&nbsp; Circumcised the Eighth Day; 2.&nbsp; Of
the Stock of Israel; 3.&nbsp; Of the Tribe of Benjamin; 4.&nbsp;
A Hebrew of the Hebrews; 5.&nbsp; As touching the Law, a
Pharisee; 6.&nbsp; Concerning Zeal, persecuting the Church.&nbsp;
The seventh was a man-of-war, with which he one day set out from
the port of Jerusalem, well supplied with ammunition from the
arsenal of the Chief Priest, with a view to destroy a small port
at Damascus.&nbsp; He was wonderfully confident, and breathed out
threatenings and slaughter.&nbsp; But he had not got far from
port before the Gospel Ship, with Jesus Christ Himself as
Commander on board, hove in sight, and threw such a shell among
the merchant&rsquo;s fleet that all his ships were instantly on
fire.&nbsp; The commotion was tremendous, and there was such a
volume of smoke that Paul could not see the sun at noon.&nbsp;
While the ships were fast sinking, the Gospel Commander
mercifully gave orders that the perishing merchant should be
taken on board.&nbsp; &lsquo;Saul, Saul, what has become of all
thy ships?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They are all on fire.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;What wilt thou do now?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh that I may
be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the
law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God. by faith.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Misplaced Bone</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let every one keep his own place, that
there be no schism in the body.&nbsp; There arose a fierce
contention in the human body; every member sought another place
than the one it found itself in, and was fitted for.&nbsp; After
much controversy, it was agreed to refer the whole matter to one
whose name was Solomon Wise-in-his-own-conceit.&nbsp; He was to
arrange, and adjust the whole business, and to place every bone
in its proper position.&nbsp; He received the appointment gladly,
and was filled with joy, and confidence.&nbsp; He commenced with
finding a place for himself.&nbsp; His proper post was the heel;
but where do you think he found it?&nbsp; He must needs <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>be the
golden bowl in which the brains were deposited.&nbsp; The natural
consequences followed.&nbsp; The coarse heel bone was not of the
right quality, nor of the suitable dimensions to contain the
brains, nor could the vessel intended for that purpose form a
useful, or comely part of the foot.&nbsp; Disorder ensued in
foot, head, face, legs, and arms.&nbsp; By the time Solomon
Wise-in-his-own-conceit had reconstructed the body, it could
neither walk, nor speak, nor smell, nor hear, nor see.&nbsp; The
body was, moreover, filled with intolerable agony, and could find
no rest, every bone crying for restoration to its own place, that
is to say, every one but the heel-bone; that was mightily pleased
to be in the head, and to have the custody of the brains.&nbsp;
Sin has introduced similar disorder amongst men, and even amongst
professors of religion, and into congregations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let
every one keep his own place, that there be no schism in the
body.&rsquo;&nbsp; The body can do much, can bear heavy burdens,
all its parts being in their own positions.&nbsp; Even so in the
Church; much good can be done by every member keeping and filling
his own place without high-mindedness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Man in the House of
Steel</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A man in a trance saw himself locked up in
a house of steel, through the walls of which, as through walls of
glass, he could see his enemies assailing him with swords,
spears, and bayonets; but his life was safe, for his fortress was
locked within.&nbsp; So is the Christian secure amid the assaults
of the world.&nbsp; His &lsquo;life is hid with Christ in
God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Psalmist prayed, &lsquo;When my heart is
overwhelmed within me, lead me to the Rock that is higher than
I.&rsquo;&nbsp; Imagine a man seated on a lofty rock in the midst
of the sea, where he has everything necessary for his support,
shelter, safety, and comfort.&nbsp; The billows heave and break
beneath him, and the hungry monsters of the deep wait to devour
him; but he is on high, above the rage of the <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>former, and
the reach of the latter.&nbsp; Such is the security of faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why need I mention the rock, and the steel house?
for the peace that is in Christ is a tower ten thousand times
stronger, and a refuge ten thousand times safer.&nbsp; Behold the
disciples of Jesus exposed to famine, nakedness, peril, and
sword&mdash;incarcerated in dungeons; thrown to wild beasts;
consumed in the fire; sawn asunder; cruelly mocked, and scourged;
driven from friends, and home, to wander among the mountains, and
lodge in dens, and caves of the earth; being destitute,
afflicted, tormented; sorrowful, but always rejoicing; cast down,
but not destroyed; an ocean of peace within, which swallows up
all their sufferings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither death,&rsquo; with all its terrors;
&lsquo;nor life,&rsquo; with all its allurements; &lsquo;nor
things present,&rsquo; with all their pleasure, &lsquo;nor things
to come,&rsquo; with all their promise; &lsquo;nor height&rsquo;
of prosperity; &lsquo;nor depth&rsquo; of adversity; &lsquo;nor
angels&rsquo; of evil; &lsquo;nor principalities&rsquo; of
darkness; &lsquo;shall be able to separate us from the love of
God which is in Christ Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;God is our
refuge, and strength; a very present help in trouble.&nbsp;
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
sea&mdash;though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though
the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
is the language of strong faith in the peace of Christ.&nbsp; How
is it with you amid such turmoil, and commotion?&nbsp; Is all
peaceful within?&nbsp; Do you feel secure in the name of the
Lord, as in a strong fortress, as in a city well supplied, and
defended?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is a river, the streams whereof shall make
glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the
most high.&nbsp; God is in the midst of her; she shall not be
moved.&nbsp; God shall help her, and that right
early.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Unto the upright, there ariseth light
in the darkness.&rsquo;&nbsp; The bright and morning star,
shining upon their pathway, cheers them in their journey home to
their Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; And when they <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>come to
pass over Jordan, the Sun of Righteousness shall have risen upon
them, with healing in His wings.&nbsp; Already they see the tops
of the mountains of immortality, gilded with his beams, beyond
the valley of the shadow of death.&nbsp; Behold, yonder, old
Simeon hoisting his sails, and saying, &lsquo;Lord, now lettest
thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine
eyes have seen Thy salvation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such is the peace of
Jesus, sealed to all them that believe by the blood of His
cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we walk through the field of battle, slippery with
blood, and strewn with the bodies of the slain&mdash;when we hear
the shrieks, and the groans of the wounded, and the
dying&mdash;when we see the country wasted, cities burned, houses
pillaged, widows, and orphans wailing in the track of the
victorious army, we cannot help exclaiming, &lsquo;Oh, what a
blessing is peace!&rsquo;&nbsp; When we are obliged to witness
family turmoils, and strifes&mdash;when we see parents, and
children, brothers, and sisters, masters, and servants, husbands,
and wives, contending with each other like tigers&mdash;we retire
as from a smoky house, and exclaim as we go, &lsquo;Oh, what a
blessing is peace!&rsquo;&nbsp; When duty calls us into that
church, where envy, and malice prevail, and the spirit of harmony
is supplanted by discord, and contention&mdash;when we see
brethren, who ought to be bound together in love, full of pride,
hatred, confusion, and every evil work&mdash;we quit the
unhallowed scene with painful feelings of repulsion, repeating
the exclamation, &lsquo;Oh, what a blessing is peace!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how much more precious in the case of the awakened
sinner!&nbsp; See him standing, terror-stricken, before
Sinai.&nbsp; Thunders roll above him&mdash;lightnings flash
around him&mdash;the earth trembles beneath him, as if ready to
open her mouth, and swallow him up.&nbsp; The sound of the
trumpet rings through his soul, &lsquo;Guilty! guilty!
guilty!&rsquo;&nbsp; Pale and trembling, he looks eagerly around
him, and sees nothing but revelations of wrath.&nbsp; Overwhelmed
with fear, and dismay, he cries out&mdash;&lsquo;O wretched man
that I am! <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>who shall deliver me!&nbsp; What shall I
do?&rsquo;&nbsp; A voice reaches his ear, penetrates his
heart&mdash;&lsquo;Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the
sin of the world!&rsquo;&nbsp; He turns his eyes to
Calvary.&nbsp; Wondrous vision!&nbsp; Emmanuel expiring upon the
cross! the sinner&rsquo;s Substitute satisfying the demand of the
law against the sinner!&nbsp; Now all his fears are hushed, and
rivers of peace flow into his soul.&nbsp; This is the peace of
Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How precious is this peace, amid all the dark
vicissitudes of life!&nbsp; How invaluable this jewel, through
all the dangers of the wilderness!&nbsp; How cheering to know
that Jesus, who hath loved us even unto death, is the pilot of
our perilous voyage; that He rules the winds, and the waves, and
can hush them to silence at His will, and bring the frailest bark
of faith to the desired haven!&nbsp; Trusting where he cannot
trace his Master&rsquo;s footsteps, the disciple is joyful amid
the darkest dispensations of Divine Providence; turning all his
sorrows into songs, and all his tribulations into triumphs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
on Thee, because he trusteth in Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Parable of the Church as an
Ark among the Bulrushes of the Nile</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see an ark of bulrushes, daubed with
slime, and pitch, placed on the banks of the Nile, which swarmed
with fierce crocodiles.&nbsp; Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter espies it,
and sends her maidens to find out what there can be in it.&nbsp;
Little Moses was there, with a face of miraculous beauty, to
charm the princess of Egypt.&nbsp; She determined to adopt him as
her son.&nbsp; Behold, a great wonder.&nbsp; On the brink of the
river, where the three great crocodiles&mdash;the Devil, Sin, and
Death&mdash;have devoured their millions, there lay those who it
was seen, before the foundation of the world, would be adopted
into the court of heaven.&nbsp; The Gospel comes forth like a
royal princess, with pardon in her hand, and mercy in her <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>eye; and
hastening with her handmaidens, she glances at the thousands
asleep in the perils of sin.&nbsp; They had favour in her sight,
and she sent for her maidens, called Justification, and
Sanctification, to train them for the inheritance of the
saints.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Handwriting</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Adam sinned, there was issued against
him the writ of death, written by the finger of God in the book
of the moral law.&nbsp; Adam had heard it read before his fall,
but in seeking to become a god, by eating of the fruit of the
tree, had forgotten it.&nbsp; Now God read it in his conscience,
and he was overwhelmed with fear.&nbsp; But the promise of a
Redeemer having been given, Mercy arranged that sacrifices should
be offered as a typical payment of the debt.&nbsp; When God
appeared on Sinai, to enter into covenant with His people, He
brought this writ in His hand, and the whole camp understood,
from the requirements of the law, that they must perish; their
lives had been forfeited.&nbsp; Mercy devised that a
bullock&rsquo;s blood should be shed, instead of the blood of
man.&nbsp; The worshippers in the temple were bound to offer
living sacrifices to God, that they might die in their stead, and
be consumed.&nbsp; Manoah feared the flames of the sacrifice that
was offered upon the rock; but his wife understood that, since
the angel had ascended in the flame, in their stead, it was a
favourable omen.&nbsp; Every worshipper, by offering other lives
instead of their own on the altars of God, acknowledged that the
&lsquo;handwriting&rsquo; was in force against them, and their
high priest had minutely to confess all their sins
&lsquo;over&rsquo; the victim.&nbsp; Yet, by all the blood that
ever crimsoned Levi&rsquo;s robe, and the altars of God, no real
atonement was made for sin, nor forgiveness procured for the
smallest crime.&nbsp; All the sacrifices made a remembrance of
sin, but were no means of pardon.&nbsp; More than two thousand
years the question had been entertained, how to reconcile man
with God.&nbsp; The &lsquo;handwriting&rsquo; was real on Mount
<a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>Ebal
every year; meanwhile the debt was fast accumulating, and new
bills were being constantly filed.&nbsp; The books were opened
from time to time; but to meet the claims there was nothing
brought to the altar but the blood of sacrifices, as a sort of
draft in the name of Christ upon the Bank of Gold.&nbsp; When
Heaven, and earth had grown weary of this fictitious or seeming,
pardon of sin, I hear a voice exclaim: &lsquo;Away with
sacrifices, and burnt-offerings: Heaven has no pleasure in them;
a body has been prepared for me.&nbsp; Lo, I come to reconcile
man with God by one sacrifice.&rsquo;&nbsp; He came,
&lsquo;leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
hills.&rsquo;&nbsp; Calling at the office where the
&lsquo;handwriting&rsquo; lay, when only eight days old, He
signed with His own blood an acknowledgment of the debt, saying:
&lsquo;This is an earnest, and a pledge that my heart&rsquo;s
blood shall be freely given.&rsquo;&nbsp; The three-and-thirty
years have expired; I see Him in Gethsemane, with the priceless
purse of gold which He had borne with Him through the courts of
Caiaphas and Pilate; but to them the image, and the
superscription on the coin was a mystery.&nbsp; The Father,
however, recognised them in the court of Sinai, where the
&lsquo;handwriting&rsquo; was that demanded the life of the whole
world.&nbsp; The day following, &lsquo;the Virgin&rsquo;s
Son&rsquo; presented Himself to pay the debt in liquid gold; and
the treasure which He bore would have set free a myriad
worlds.&nbsp; He passes along the streets of Jerusalem towards
Sinai&rsquo;s office; the mercy-seat is removed to &lsquo;the
place of skulls;&rsquo; as He proceeds, He exclaims: &lsquo;I am
come not to destroy, but to fulfil the law.&rsquo;&nbsp; Send in,
before the hour of three, each curse, and threat ever pronounced
against my people.&nbsp; Bring in the first old bill against Adam
as their head.&nbsp; I will redeem a countless host of infants
to-day; their names shall be taken out of old Eden&rsquo;s
accounts.&nbsp; Bring in the many transgressions which have been
filed through the ages, from Adam until now; include
Peter&rsquo;s denial of me last night; but as to Judas, he is a
son of perdition, he has no part in me, having sold me <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>for thirty
pieces of silver.&nbsp; We have here an exhaustless crimson
treasure,&mdash;enough to meet the demand; enough to fill every
promise, and every prophecy with mercy; enough to make my
beloved, and myself happy, and blest for ever!&nbsp; By three in
the afternoon of that day, there was not a bill in all Eden, or
Sinai, that had not been brought to the cross.&nbsp; And when all
was settled, Christ bowed down His head, but cried with a loud
voice: &lsquo;It is finished!&rsquo;&nbsp; The gates of death,
and hell trembled, and shook.&nbsp; &lsquo;The posts of the doors
moved at the voice.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great gulf between God, and
His people was closed up.&nbsp; Sinai appeared with the offering,
and grew still; the lightnings no longer flashed, and the thunder
ceased to roar.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Death as an
Inoculator</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Death may be conceived of as a gigantic
inoculator.&nbsp; He carries about with him a monstrous box,
filled with deadly matter, with which he has infected every child
of Adam.&nbsp; The whole race of man is doomed by this law of
death.&nbsp; But see!&nbsp; This old inoculator gets paid back in
his own coin.&nbsp; The Son of Man, humbling Himself to death,
descends into the tomb, but rises immortal.&nbsp; He seized death
in Joseph&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; But, amazing spectacle! with the
matter of His own immortality He inoculated mortality with death,
whose lifeless corpse will be seen, on the resurrection morning,
among the ruins of His people&rsquo;s graves; while they, with
one voice, will rend the air as if eternity opened its mouth,
exclaiming: &lsquo;O death, where is thy sting?&nbsp; O grave,
where is thy victory?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Time</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Time, considered as a whole, is the age of
the visible creation.&nbsp; It began with the fiat, &lsquo;Let
there be light;&rsquo; and it will end with the words:
&lsquo;Come, ye blessed of my Father,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Go, ye
cursed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Each river, and mountain, <a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>town, and
city, hovel, and palace, every son, and daughter of Adam, must
undergo the change, pass away, for whatever is seen is only for a
time.&nbsp; The time of restoration, by the presence of the glory
of Christ, will be the morning of judgment, and
resurrection.&nbsp; That morning will be the last of time: then
eternity begins.&nbsp; From that time, each man will dwell in his
everlasting home: the ungodly in a lake of fire, that will burn
for ever; while the joy, and happiness of the blest will know no
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the fearfulness of the word <i>everlasting</i>,
written over the door of the lake of fire!&nbsp; Oh the happiness
it will create when read above the eternal kingdom!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is the age of the visible world; but eternity is
the age of God.&nbsp; This limitless circle centres in Him.&nbsp;
The age of the visible world is divided into years, and days,
according to the revolutions of the earth, and sun,&mdash;into
weeks, in memory of the world&rsquo;s creation, and the
resurrection of Christ,&mdash;into hours, minutes, seconds, and
moments.&nbsp; These last can scarcely be distinguished, yet they
are parts of the great body of time; but seven thousand years
constitute no part of eternity.&nbsp; One day, and a thousand
years, yea, millions of years, are alike, compared with the age
of God, forming no part of the vast changeless circle that knows
neither loss, nor gain.&nbsp; The age of time is winding up by
minutes, days, and years: the age of God is one endless to-day;
and such will be your age, and mine, when we have once passed the
limits of time, beyond which Lazarus is blessed, and the rich man
tormented.&nbsp; My brethren in the ministry, who in years gone
by travelled with me from one Association to another, are to-day
living in that great endless hour!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is an age of changes, revolutions, and reforms;
but eternity is calm, stationary, and changeless.&nbsp; He who
enters upon it an enemy to God, faithless, prayerless,
unpardoned, and unregenerate, remains so for ever.&nbsp; Great
changes take place in time, for which the new song in <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>eternity
will never cease.&nbsp; Natures have been changed, and enmity has
been abolished.&nbsp; In time, the life covenant was broken, and
man formed, and sealed his compact with hell.&nbsp; One, equal
with God, died upon the cross, in the form of a servant, to
destroy the works of the devil, and to unite man, and God in the
bond of peace through His own blood.&nbsp; Time, and language
would fail to recount what in time has been accomplished,
involving changes from life, to death, and from death, to
life.&nbsp; Here the pure have become denied, and the guiltless
condemned; and here, also, the sinner has been justified, the
polluted cleansed, the poor enriched, the enemy reconciled, and
the dead have been made alive, where one paradise has been lost,
and a better regained.&nbsp; The new song from the midst of
eternity sounds in our ears.&nbsp; Hear it!&nbsp; It has for its
subjects one event that took place in eternity, and three that
have transpired in time: &lsquo;Unto Him that loved us, and
washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings,
and priests unto God, and His Father: to Him be glory, and
dominion for ever, and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Timepiece</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You may move the hands on the dial-plate
this way, and the other, and finger as you please the machinery
within, but if there be no mainspring there your labour will be
in vain.&nbsp; So the &lsquo;hands&rsquo; of men&rsquo;s lives
will not move, in holy obedience, at the touch of the law, unless
the mainspring be supplied by God through the Gospel; then only
will the whole life revolve on the pivot of the love of Christ,
as upon an imperishable diamond.&nbsp; It is not difficult to get
the timepiece to act well, if the internal machinery be in proper
order; so, with a right spirit within, Lydia attends to the word,
Matthew leaves &lsquo;the receipt of custom,&rsquo; Saul of
Tarsus prays; and the three thousand repent, believe, and turn
unto the Lord.</p>
<p><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>&ldquo;A gentleman&rsquo;s timepieces were once out of
order, and they were examined, when it was found that in one of
them the mainspring was injured; the glass which protected the
dial-plate of the other was broken; while the machinery of the
third had got damp, and rusty, although the parts were all
there.&nbsp; So the lack of holiness, in some cases, arises from
the want of heart to love God; another man has not the glass of
watchfulness in his conduct; another has got rusty with
backsliding from God, and the sense of guilt so clogs the wheels
of his machinery, that they must be well brushed with rebuke, and
correction, and oiled afresh with the Divine influence, before
they will ever go well again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole of a Christian&rsquo;s life is a reaching
forward; but he has to begin afresh, like the people of Israel in
the wilderness; or, like a clock, he has constantly to recommence
at the figure one, and go on to that of twelve, through all the
years of his experience on earth.&nbsp; But after the
resurrection, he will advance, body, and soul, to the figure of
million of millions, never to begin again throughout
eternity.&nbsp; The sun in that world will never rise, nor set;
it will have neither east, nor west!&nbsp; How often has an
invisible hand wound up thy religious spirit below, but there the
weights will never come down again!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Parable of the Birds</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A gentleman kept in his palace a dove, a
raven, and an eagle.&nbsp; There was but little congeniality, or
friendship amongst them.&nbsp; The dove ate its own proper food,
and lodged in the aviary.&nbsp; The raven fed on carrion, and
sometimes would pick out the eyes of an innocent lamb, and had
her nest in the branches of a tree.&nbsp; The eagle was a royal
bird; it flew very high, and was of a savage nature; it would
care nothing to eat half-a-dozen doves for its breakfast.&nbsp;
It was considered the chief of all birds, because it could fly
higher than all.&nbsp; All the doves feared its beak, <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>its angry
eyes, and sharp talons.&nbsp; When the gentleman threw corn in
the yard for the dove, the raven would be engaged in eating a
piece of flesh, a part of a lamb haply; and the eagle in carrying
a child from the cradle to its eyrie.&nbsp; The dove is the
evangelical, industrious, godly professor; the raven is the
licentious, and unmanageable professor; and the eagle the
high-minded, and self-complacent one.&nbsp; These characters are
too often amongst us; there is no denomination in church, or
meeting-house, without these three birds, if there be birds there
at all.&nbsp; These birds, so unlike, so opposed, never can live
together in peace.&nbsp; Let us pray, brethren, for union of
spirit in the bond of peace.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Parable of the Vine-tree, the
Thorn, the Bramble, and the Cedar</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The trees of Lebanon held a council to
elect a king, on the death of their old sovereign, the
Yew-tree.&nbsp; It was agreed to offer the sovereignty to the
Cedar; at the same time, in the event of the Cedar&rsquo;s
declining it, to the Vine-tree, and then to the Olive-tree.&nbsp;
They all refused it.&nbsp; The Cedar said, &lsquo;I am high
enough already.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Vine said, &lsquo;I prefer
giving forth my rich juice to gladden man&rsquo;s
heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; In like manner, the Olive was content with
giving its fruit, and would receive no other honour.&nbsp;
Recourse was then had to the Thorn.&nbsp; The Thorn gladly
received the office; saying to itself, &lsquo;I have nothing to
lose but this white dress, and a berry for pigs, while I have
prickles enough to annoy the whole wood.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bramble
rebelled against the Thorn, and a fire of pride, and envy was
kindled, which, at length, wrapped the whole forest in one
blaze.&nbsp; Two or three vain, and high-minded men have
frequently broken up the peace of congregations; and, by striving
for the mastery, have inflicted on the cause of religion
incalculable injuries; when they have had no more fitness for
rule than the white-thorn, or the prickly bramble.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>The
following extract is of another order; it is more lengthy, and it
is upon a theme which always drew forth the preacher&rsquo;s most
exulting notes:&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Resurrection of our
Lord</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let us now consider the fact of our
Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, and its bearing upon the great truths
of our holy religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This most transcendent of miracles is sometimes
attributed to the agency of the Father; who, as the Lawgiver, had
arrested, and imprisoned in the grave the sinner&rsquo;s Surety,
manifesting at once His benevolence, and His holiness; but by
liberating the prisoner, proclaimed that the debt was cancelled,
and the claims of the law satisfied.&nbsp; It is sometimes
attributed to the Son Himself; who had power both to lay down His
life, and to take it again; and the merit of whose sacrifice
entitled Him to the honour of thus asserting His dominion over
death, on behalf of His people.&nbsp; And sometimes it is
attributed to the Holy Spirit, as in the following words of the
Apostle:&mdash;&lsquo;He was declared to be the Son of God with
power, according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the resurrection
from the dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The resurrection of Christ is a clear and
incontestable proof of His Divinity</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had declared Himself equal with God the Father, and
one with Him in nature, and in glory.&nbsp; He had told the
people that He would prove the truth of this declaration, by
rising from the grave three days after His death.&nbsp; And when
the morning of the third day began to dawn upon the sepulchre,
lo! there was an earthquake, and the dead body arose, triumphant
over the power of corruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the most stupendous miracle ever exhibited on
earth, and its language is:&mdash;&lsquo;Behold, ye persecuting
Jews and murdering Romans, the proof of my Godhead!&nbsp; Behold,
Caiaphas, Herod, Pilate, the power, and glory of your
Victim!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am He that liveth, and was dead;
and lo! <a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>I am alive for evermore!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the
root, and the offspring of David, and the Bright, and Morning
Star!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all ye
ends of the earth; for I am God, and besides Me there is none
else!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection affords
incontrovertible evidence of the truth of Christianity</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilate wrote the title of Christ in three languages on
the cross; and many have written excellent, and unanswerable
things, on the truth of the Christian Scriptures, and the reality
of the Christian religion; but the best argument that has ever
been written on the subject was written by the invisible hand of
the Eternal Power, in the rocks of our Saviour&rsquo;s
sepulchre.&nbsp; This confounds the sceptic, settles the
controversy, and affords an ample, and sure foundation for all
them that believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any one asks whether Christianity is from heaven, or
of men, we point him to the &lsquo;tomb hewn out of the
rock,&rsquo; and say&mdash;&lsquo;There is your answer!&nbsp;
Jesus was crucified, and laid in that cave; but on the morning of
the third day it was found empty; our Master had risen, and gone
forth from the grave victorious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the pillar that supports the whole fabric of
our religion; and he who attempts to pull it down, like Samson,
pulls ruin upon himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Christ is not risen,
then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain, ye are
yet in your sins;&rsquo; but if the fact is clearly proved, then
Christianity is unquestionably true, and its disciples are
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the ground on which the Apostle stood, and
asserted the divinity of his faith:&mdash;&lsquo;Moreover, I
testify unto you the gospel, which I preached unto you; which
also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are
saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye
have believed in vain; for I delivered unto you first of all that
which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures, and that He <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>was buried,
and that He rose again the third day, according to the
Scriptures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The resurrection of Jesus is the most stupendous
manifestation of the power of God</i>, <i>and the pledge of
eternal life to His people</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The apostle calls it &lsquo;the exceeding greatness of
His power to usward, who believe, according to the working of His
mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from
the dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a river overflowing its
banks&mdash;an idea too large for language.&nbsp; Let us look at
it a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we find &lsquo;the exceeding greatness of His
power&rsquo;?&nbsp; In the creation of the world? in the seven
Stars and Orion? in the strength of Behemoth and Leviathan?&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; In the Deluge? in the fiery destruction of Sodom? in
the overthrow of Pharaoh, and his host? in hurling
Nebuchadnezzar, like Lucifer, from the political firmament?&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; It is the power which He wrought in Christ.&nbsp;
When?&nbsp; When He healed the sick? when He raised the dead?
when He cast out devils? when He blasted the fruitless fig-tree?
when He walked upon the waters of Galilee?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It was
&lsquo;when He raised Him from the dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the
Father placed the sceptre in the hands of the Son, &lsquo;and set
Him above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in
that which is to come; and put all things under His feet, and
gave Him to be Head over all things to the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the source of our spiritual life.&nbsp; The
same power that raised the dead body of our Lord from the grave,
quickens the soul of the believer from the death in trespasses,
and sins.&nbsp; His riven tomb is a fountain of living waters;
whereof, if a man drink, he shall never die.&nbsp; His raised,
and glorified body is the sun, whence streams eternal light upon
our spirits; the light of life, that never can be quenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor here does the influence of His resurrection
end.&nbsp; <a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>&lsquo;He who raised up Jesus from the dead shall,
also, quicken our mortal bodies.&rsquo;&nbsp; His resurrection is
the pledge, and the pattern of ours.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because He
lives, we shall live also.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He shall change
our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious
body.&rsquo;&nbsp; We hear Him speaking in the
Prophet:&mdash;&lsquo;Thy dead shall live; together with my dead
body shall they arise.&nbsp; Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in
the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall
cast out her dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How divinely does the Apostle speak of the
resurrection-body of the saints!&nbsp; &lsquo;It is sown in
corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in
dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is
raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a
spiritual body.&nbsp; For this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.&nbsp; Then
shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: &lsquo;Death
is swallowed up in victory!&nbsp; O death, where is thy
victory?&nbsp; O grave, where is thy sting?&nbsp; Thanks be unto
God that giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since the fall in Eden, man is born to die.&nbsp;
He lives to die.&nbsp; He eats, and drinks, sleeps, and wakes, to
die.&nbsp; Death, like a dark steel-clad warrior, stands ever
before us; and his gigantic shadow comes continually between us,
and happiness.&nbsp; But Christ hath &lsquo;abolished death, and
brought life, and immortality to light through the
gospel.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was born in Bethlehem, that He might die
on Calvary.&nbsp; He was made under the law, that He might bear
the direst penalty of the law.&nbsp; He lived thirty-three years,
sinless, among sinners, that He might offer Himself a
sin-offering for sinners upon the cross.&nbsp; Thus &lsquo;He
became obedient unto death,&rsquo; that He might destroy the
power of death; and on the third morning, a mighty angel, rolling
away the stone from the mouth of the sepulchre, makes the very
door of death&rsquo;s castle the throne whence He proclaims
&lsquo;the resurrection, and the life.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>&ldquo;The Hero of our salvation travelled into
Death&rsquo;s dominion, took possession of the whole territory on
our behalf, and returning, laden with spoils, ascended to the
Heaven of heavens.&nbsp; He went to the palace, seized the
tyrant, and wrested away his sceptre.&nbsp; He descended into the
prison-house, knocked off the fetters of the captives; and when
He came up again, left the door of every cell open, that they
might follow Him.&nbsp; He has gone over into our promised
inheritance, and His glory illuminates the mountains of
immortality; and through the telescope which He has bequeathed us
we &lsquo;see the land which is very far off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recollect reading, in the writings of Flavel, this
sentiment&mdash;that the souls in Paradise wait, with intense
desire, for the reanimation of their dead bodies, that they may
be united to them in bliss for ever.&nbsp; Oh what rapture there
shall be among the saints, when those frail vessels, from which
they escaped with such a struggle, as they foundered in the gulf
of death, shall come floating in, with the spring-tide of the
resurrection, to the harbour of immortality!&nbsp; How glorious
the reunion, when the seeds of affliction, and death are left
behind in the tomb!&nbsp; Jacob no longer lame, nor Moses slow of
speech, nor Lazarus covered with sores, nor Paul troubled with a
thorn in the flesh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we
know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we
shall see Him as He is.&rsquo;&nbsp; The glory of the body of
Christ is far above our present conception.&nbsp; When He was
transfigured on Tabor, His face shone like the sun, and His
raiment was white as the light.&nbsp; This is the pattern shown
to His people on the mount.&nbsp; This is the model after which
the bodies of believers shall be fashioned in the
resurrection.&nbsp; &lsquo;They that be wise shall shine as the
brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to
righteousness, as the stars for ever, and ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>&ldquo;In conclusion:&mdash;The angel said to the
woman, &lsquo;Go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen
from the dead; and behold, He goeth before you into Galilee;
there shall ye see Him; lo!&nbsp; I have told you.&nbsp; And they
departed quickly from the sepulchre, with fear, and great joy;
and did run to bring His disciples word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren! followers of Jesus! be ye also preachers of a
risen Saviour!&nbsp; Go quickly&mdash;there is no time for
delay&mdash;and publish the glad tidings to sinners!&nbsp; Tell
them that Christ died for their sins, and rose again for their
justification, and ascended to the right hand of the Father to
make intercession for them, and is now able to save unto the
uttermost all that come unto God by Him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, impenitent, and unbelieving men! hear this
blessed message of salvation!&nbsp; Do you intend ever to embrace
the proffered mercy of the Gospel?&nbsp; Make haste!&nbsp;
Procrastination is ruin!&nbsp; Now is the accepted time!&nbsp;
Oh, fly to the throne of grace!&nbsp; Time is hastening; you will
soon be swallowed up in eternity!&nbsp; May the Lord have mercy
upon you, and rouse you from your indifference, and sloth!&nbsp;
It is my delight to invite you to Christ; but I feel more
pleasure, and more confidence in praying for you to God.&nbsp; I
have besought, and entreated you, by every argument, and every
motive in my power; but you are yet in your sins, and rushing on
toward hell.&nbsp; Yet I will not give you up in despair.&nbsp;
If I cannot persuade you to flee from the wrath to come, I will
intercede with God to have mercy upon you, for the sake of His
beloved Son.&nbsp; If I cannot prevail in the pulpit, I will try
to prevail at the throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This must be regarded as a very noble piece; the words make
themselves felt; evidently, the resurrection of our Lord, to this
preacher, was a great reality; it is now, by many, regarded only
as a charming myth; a very curious eschatology in our <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>day has
found its way even into our pulpits, and we have eminent
ministers of the Church of England, well-known Congregational,
and other ministers, who affect to believe, and to preach the
Resurrection of Christ; but a careful listener in the pew, or a
converser by the fireside, will find, to his amazement, that the
resurrection, as believed by them, is no honest resurrection at
all: it is a spiritual resurrection which leaves the body of
Jesus unrisen, and in the possession of death, and the
grave.&nbsp; In that view, which has just passed before us, a
very different, and most absolutely real resurrection is
preached; indeed, it is the only view which leaves a heart of
immortal hope in the Christian faith, the only view which seems
at all tenable, if we are to believe in the power of
Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>We will close these extracts by one of yet another
order,&mdash;a vivid descriptive picture of the smiting of the
rock, the streams flowing through the desert, and the joy of the
mighty caravan of pilgrims on their way to the promised land.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">They drank of that Rock
which followed Them</span>.&rsquo;</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having spoken of <i>the smiting</i>, let
us, <i>now</i>, look at <i>the result</i>, the flowing of the
waters; a timely mercy to &lsquo;the many thousands of
Israel,&rsquo; on the point of perishing in the desert; shadowing
forth a far greater mercy, the flowing of living waters from the
&lsquo;spiritual rock,&rsquo; which is Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the death of our Redeemer, we see three infinite
depths moved for the relief of human misery: the love of the
Father, the merit of the Son, and the energy of the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; These are the depths of wonder whence arise the
rivers of salvation.</p>
<p><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>&ldquo;<i>The waters flowed in the presence of the
whole assembly</i>.&nbsp; The agent was invisible, but His work
was manifest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water flowed <i>in great abundance</i>, filling the
whole camp, and supplying all the people.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
the immense number, and the greatness of their thirst, there was
enough for each, and for all.&nbsp; The streams ran in every
direction to meet the sufferers, and their rippling murmur seemed
to say&mdash;&lsquo;Open thy mouth, and I will fill
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Look to the cross!&nbsp; See there the gracious
fountain opened, and streams of pardoning, and purifying mercy
flowing down the rock of Calvary, sweeping over the mount of
Olives, and cleaving it asunder, to make a channel for the living
waters to go out over the whole world, that God may be glorified
among the Gentiles, and all the ends of the earth may see His
salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water flowed <i>from the rock</i>, not pumped by
human labour, but drawn by the hand of God.&nbsp; It was the same
power that opened the springs of mercy upon the cross.&nbsp; It
was the wisdom of God that devised the plan, and the mercy of God
that furnished the Victim.&nbsp; His was the truth, and love that
gave the promise by the prophet&mdash;&lsquo;In that day there
shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin, and uncleanness.&rsquo;&nbsp;
His was the unchanging faithfulness that fulfilled it in His
Son&mdash;&lsquo;Not by works of righteousness which we have
done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He shed on us
abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our
salvation is wholly of God; and we have no other agency in the
matter than the mere acceptance of His proffered grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water flowed <i>in twelve different channels</i>;
and, according to Dr. Pococke, of Scotland, who visited the
place, the deep traces in the rock are visible to this day.&nbsp;
But the twelve streams, one for each tribe, all issued from the
same fountain, in the same rock.&nbsp; So the great salvation
flowed <a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>out through the ministry of the twelve apostles of the
Lamb, and went abroad over all the earth.&nbsp; But the fountain
is one.&nbsp; All the apostles preached the same Saviour, and
pointed to the same cross.&nbsp; &lsquo;Neither is there
salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven,
given among men, whereby we must be saved.&rsquo;&nbsp; We must
come to this spring, or perish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flowing of the waters <i>was irresistible by human
power</i>.&nbsp; Who can close the fountain which God hath
opened? can Edom, or Moab, or Sihon, or Og dam up the current
which Jehovah hath drawn from the rock?&nbsp; Can Caiaphas, and
all the Jews, aided by the prince of this world&mdash;can all the
powers of earth and hell combined&mdash;arrest the work of
redemption, and dry up the fountain of mercy which Christ is
opening on Calvary?&nbsp; As soon might they dry up the Atlantic,
and stop the revolutions of the globe.&nbsp; It is written, and
must be fulfilled.&nbsp; Christ must suffer, and enter into His
glory&mdash;must be lifted up, and draw all men unto
Him&mdash;and repentance, and remission of sins must be preached
in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The water flowing from the rock was like a river of
life to the children of Israel</i>.&nbsp; Who can describe the
distress throughout the camp, and the appearance of the people,
when they were invited to approach a flinty rock, instead of a
fountain, or a stream, to quench their thirst?&nbsp; What angry
countenances were there, what bitter censures, and ungrateful
murmurings, as Moses went up to the rock, with nothing in his
hand but a rod!&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is he going,&rsquo; said they,
&lsquo;with that dry stick?&nbsp; What is he going to do on that
rock?&nbsp; Does he mean to make fools of us all?&nbsp; Is it not
enough that he has brought us into this wilderness to die of
thirst?&nbsp; Will he mock us now by pretending to seek water in
these sands, or open fountains in the solid granite?&rsquo;&nbsp;
But see! he lifts the rod, he smites the rock; and lo, it bursts
into a fountain; and twelve crystal streams roll down <a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>before the
people!&nbsp; Who can conceive the sudden transport?&nbsp; Hear
the shout of joy ringing through the camp, and rolling back in
tumultuous echoes from the crags, and cliffs of
Horeb,&mdash;&lsquo;Water! water!&nbsp; A miracle! a
miracle!&nbsp; Glory to the God of Israel! glory to His servant
Moses!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a resurrection-day to Israel, the
morning light bursting upon the shadow of death.&nbsp; New life,
and joy are seen throughout the camp.&nbsp; The maidens are
running with cups, and pitchers, to the rock.&nbsp; They fill,
and drink; then fill again, and haste away to their respective
tents, with water for the sick, the aged, and the little ones,
joyfully exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Drink, father!&nbsp; Drink,
mother!&nbsp; Drink, children!&nbsp; Drink, all of you!&nbsp;
Drink abundantly!&nbsp; Plenty of water now!&nbsp; Rivers flowing
from the rock!&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the oxen are coming, the asses,
the camels, the sheep, and the goats&mdash;coming in crowds to
quench their thirst, and plunging into the streams before
them.&nbsp; And the feathered tribes are coming, the turtle-dove,
the pigeon, the swallow, the sparrow, the robin, and the wren;
while the croaking raven, and the fierce-eyed eagle, scenting the
water from afar, mingle with them round the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, this is but a faint emblem of the joy of the
Church, in drinking the waters that descend from Calvary, the
streams that gladden the city of our God.&nbsp; Go back to the
day of Pentecost for an instance.&nbsp; Oh what a revolution of
thought, and feeling, and character!&nbsp; What a change of
countenance, and conscience, and heart!&nbsp; Three thousand men,
that morning full of ignorance, and corruption, and
guilt&mdash;idolaters, sensualists, blasphemers,
persecutors&mdash;before night were perfectly
transformed&mdash;the lions converted into lambs&mdash;the hard
heart melted, the dead conscience quickened, and the whole man
become a new creature in Christ Jesus!&nbsp; They thirsted, they
found the &lsquo;Spiritual rock,&rsquo; tasted its living waters,
and suddenly leaped into new life, like Lazarus from the
inanition of the grave!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the blessing which follows the Church through
<a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>all her
wanderings in the wilderness, accompanies her through the
scorching desert of affliction, and the valley of the shadow of
death; and when, at last, she shall come up out of great
tribulation, her garments shall be found washed and made white in
the blood of the Lamb; and the Lamb, who is in the midst of the
throne, shall lead her to everlasting fountains, and she shall
thirst no more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the great Welsh preachers, then, in closing, it will now
be enough to say, that, without claiming for Christmas Evans
pre-eminence above all his contemporaries, or countrymen, it may,
with truth, be said, we have yet better means of forming an
opinion of him than of any other.&nbsp; We have attempted to
avail ourselves of such traditions, and stories of their pulpit
ministration, and such fragments of their spoken words, as may
convey some, if faint, still fair, idea of their powers.&nbsp;
Even of Christmas Evans our knowledge is, by no means, ample, nor
are there many of his sermons left to us; but such as we possess
seem sufficient for the formation of as high an estimate, through
the medium of criticism, and the press, as that which was formed
by the flocking crowds, and thousands who deemed it one of their
greatest privileges, and pleasures to listen to his living
voice.&nbsp; And it must be admitted, we think, that these
sermons are of that order which retains much of its power, when
the voice through which it spoke is still.&nbsp; Welsh sermons,
beyond almost any others, lose their vitality by the transference
to the press, and no doubt this preacher suffers in this way,
too; some, however, will not bear the printing machine at all,
and when the voice ceases to speak, all which made <a
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>them
effective is gone.&nbsp; With these sermons it is, undoubtedly,
otherwise, and from some of them it may, perhaps, even be
possible to find models of the mould of thought, and the mode at
once of arrangement, as well as the qualities of emotion, and
expression, which make preaching successful, whether for
converting, or comforting the souls of men.&nbsp; Nor is it less
significant that this man, who exercised a ministry of immense
usefulness for more than half a century, and retained his power
over men, with the same average freshness, and splendour until
within four days of his death, did so in virtue of the living
freshness of his heart, and mind.&nbsp; Like such men as John
Bunyan, and Richard Baxter, no University could claim him, for he
was of none; he had graduated in no college, had sat before no
academical prelections, and was decorated with no
diplomas,&mdash;only the Divine Spirit was master of the college
in which he was schooled.&nbsp; We write this with no desire to
speak disparagingly of such training, but, rather, to bring out
into conspicuous honour the strength of this self-formed,
severely toiling, and nobly suffering man.&nbsp; He was a
spiritual athlete in labours more abundant; perhaps it might seem
that the &ldquo;one-eyed man of Anglesea,&rdquo; as he was so
familiarly called, until this designation yielded to the more
affectionate term of &ldquo;Old Christmas,&rdquo; throughout the
Principality&mdash;must have been in bodily presence
contemptible; but if his appearance was rugged, we suppose it
could scarcely have been less than royal,&mdash;a man the spell
of whose name, when he came into a neighbourhood, could wake up
all the sleepy villages, and bid their inhabitants pour <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>along, up
by the hills, and down by the valleys, expectant crowds watching
his appearance with tears, and sometimes hailing him with
shouts&mdash;must have been something like a king among
men.&nbsp; We have seen how poor he was, and how indifferent to
all that the world regarded as wealth, but he was one of those of
whom the apostle speaks &ldquo;as poor, yet making many rich, as
having nothing, and yet possessing all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thus, from every consideration, whether we regard his singular
genius, so truly national, and representative of the mind, and
character of his country, his indomitable struggles, and earnest
self-training, his extraordinary power over his congregations,
his long, earnest life of self-denying usefulness, especially his
intense reality, the holy purity, and consecration of his soul,
Christmas Evans deserves our reverent memory while we glorify God
in him.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Time of Reformation</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Until the time of
reformation</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heb</span>. ix.
10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ceremonies pertaining to the service of God, under
Sinaitic dispensation, were entirely typical in their character;
mere figures of Christ, the &ldquo;High-priest of good things to
<a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>come, by
a greater, and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
hands;&rdquo; who, &ldquo;not by the blood of goats, and calves,
but by His own blood, has entered once into the holy place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sustaining such a relation to other ages, and events, they were
necessarily imperfect, consisting &ldquo;only in meats, and
drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances,&rdquo; not
intended for perpetual observance, but imposed upon the Jewish
people merely &ldquo;until the time of reformation,&rdquo; when
the shadow should give place to the substance, and a Greater than
Moses should &ldquo;make all things new.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us
notice the time of reformation, and the reformation itself.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Time may be divided into three parts; the Golden Age
before the fall, the Iron Age after the fall, and the
Messiah&rsquo;s Age of Jubilee.</p>
<p>In the Golden Age, the heavens, and the earth were created;
the Garden of Eden was planted; man was made in the image of God,
and placed in the garden, to dress, and keep it; matrimony was
instituted; and God, resting from His labour, sanctified the
seventh day, as a day of holy rest to man.</p>
<p>The Iron Age was introduced by the temptation of a foreigner,
who obtruded himself into Paradise, and persuaded its happy
denizens to cast off the golden yoke of obedience, and love to
God.&nbsp; Man, desiring independence, became a rebel against
heaven, a miserable captive of sin, and Satan, obnoxious to the
Divine displeasure, and exposed to eternal death.&nbsp; The law
was violated; the image of God was lost, and the enemy came in
like a flood.&nbsp; All communication between the island of Time,
and the continent of Immortality was cut off, and the unhappy
exiles saw no hope of crossing the ocean that intervened.</p>
<p>The Messiah&rsquo;s Age may be divided into three parts; the
time of Preparation, the time of Actual War, and the time of
Victory and Triumph.</p>
<p>The Preparation began with the dawning of the day in <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>Eden, when
the Messiah came in the ship of the Promise, and landed on the
island of Time, and notified its inhabitants of His gracious
intention to visit them again, and assume their nature, and live
and die among them; to break their covenant allegiance to the
prince of the iron yoke; and deliver to them the charter, signed,
and sealed with His own blood, for the redemption, and renovation
of their island, and the restoration of its suspended intercourse
with the land of Eternal Life.&nbsp; The motto inscribed upon the
banners of this age was,&mdash;&ldquo;He shall bruise thy heel,
and Thou shalt bruise his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Jehovah
thundered forth His hatred of sin from the thick darkness, and
wrote His curse in fire upon the face of heaven; while rivers of
sacrificial blood proclaimed the miserable state of man, and his
need of a costlier atonement than mere humanity could
offer.&nbsp; Here, also, the spirit of Messiah fell upon the
prophets, leading them to search diligently for the way of
deliverance, and enabling them to &ldquo;testify beforehand of
the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the season of Actual War.&nbsp; &ldquo;Messiah the
Prince&rdquo; was born in Bethlehem, wrapped in swaddling bands,
and laid in a manger,&mdash;the Great Deliverer, &ldquo;made of a
woman, made under the law, to redeem those that were under the
law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With His almighty hand, He laid hold on the works of the devil,
unlocked the iron furnace, and broke the brazen bands
asunder.&nbsp; He opened His mouth, and the deaf heard, the blind
saw, the dumb spoke, the lame walked, and the lepers were
cleansed.&nbsp; In the house of Jairus, in the street of Nain,
and in the burial ground of Bethany, His word was mightier than
death; and the damsel on her bed, the young man on his bier, and
Lazarus in his tomb, rising to second life, were but the earnests
of His future triumph.&nbsp; The diseases of sin He healed, the
iron chains of guilt He shattered, and all the horrible caves of
human corruption, and misery were opened by the Heavenly
Warrior.&nbsp; He took our yoke, and bore it <a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>away upon
His own shoulder, and cast it, broken, into the bottomless
pit.&nbsp; He felt in His hands, and feet, the nails, and in His
side the spear.&nbsp; The iron entered into His soul, but the
corrosive power of His blood destroyed it, and shall ultimately
eat away all the iron in the kingdom of death.&nbsp; Behold Him
hanging on Calvary, nailing upon His cross three bills, the
handwriting of the law which was against us, the oath of our
allegiance to the prince of darkness, and the charter of the
&ldquo;everlasting covenant;&rdquo; fulfilling the first,
breaking the second, and sealing the third with His blood!</p>
<p>Now begins the scene of Victory and Triumph.&nbsp; On the
morning of the third day, the Conqueror is seen &ldquo;coming
from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has
&ldquo;trodden the winepress alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the might of
His single arm He has routed the hosts of hell, and spoiled the
dominions of death.&nbsp; The iron castle of the foe is
demolished, and the Hero returns from the war, &ldquo;glorious in
His apparel, travelling in the greatness of His
strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; He enters the gates of the everlasting
city, amid the rejoicing of angels, and the shouts of His
redeemed.&nbsp; And still He rides forth in the chariot of His
grace, &ldquo;conquering, and to conquer.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
two-edged sword issues from His mouth, and, in His train, follow
the victorious armies of heaven.&nbsp; Lo! before Him fall the
altars of idols, and the temples of devils; and the slaves of sin
are becoming the servants, and sons of the living God; and the
proud sceptic beholds, wonders, believes, and adores; and the
blasphemer begins to pray, and the persecutor is melted into
penitence, and love, and the wolf comes, and lays him down gently
by the side of the lamb.&nbsp; And Messiah shall never quit the
field, till He has completed the conquest, and swallowed up death
in victory.&nbsp; In His &ldquo;vesture dipped in blood,&rdquo;
He shall pursue the armies of Gog and Magog on the field of
Amageddon, and break the iron teeth of the beast of power, and
cast down Babylon as a mill-stone into the sea, and bind the old
serpent in the lake of fire, and brimstone, and raise up to life
immortal <a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>the tenants of the grave.&nbsp; Then shall the New
Jerusalem, the metropolis of Messiah&rsquo;s golden empire,
descend from heaven, adorned with all the jewellery of creation,
guarded at every gate by angelic sentinels, and enlightened by
the glory of God, and of the Lamb; and the faithful shall dwell
within its walls, and sin, and sorrow, and death, shall be shut
out for ever!</p>
<p>Then shall Time be swallowed up in Eternity.&nbsp; The
righteous shall inherit life everlasting, and the ungodly shall
find their portion in the second death.&nbsp; Time is the age of
the visible world; eternity is the age of the invisible
God.&nbsp; All things in time are changeful; all things in
eternity are immutable.&nbsp; If you pass from time to eternity,
without faith in Christ, without love in God, an enemy to prayer,
an enemy to holiness, &ldquo;impurged and unforgiven,&rdquo; so
you must ever remain.&nbsp; Now is the season of that blessed
change, for which myriads shall sing everlasting anthems of
praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden
not your hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; To-day the office is open: if you
have any business with the Governor, make no delay.&nbsp; Now He
has time to talk with the woman of Samaria by the well, and the
penitent thief upon the cross.&nbsp; Now He is ready to forgive
your sins, and renew your souls, and make you meet to become the
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.&nbsp; Now He
waits to wash the filthy, and feed the hungry, and clothe the
naked, and raise the humble, and quicken the spiritually dead,
and enrich the poor, and wretched, and reconcile enemies by His
blood.&nbsp; He came to unloose your bands, and open to you the
gates of Eden; condemned for your acquittal, and slain for the
recovery of your forfeited immortality.&nbsp; The design of all
the travelling from heaven to earth, and from earth to heaven, is
the salvation of that which was lost, the restoration of
intercourse, and amity between the Maker and the worm.&nbsp; This
is the chief of the ways of God to man, ancient in its origin,
wise in its contrivance, dear in its accomplishment, powerful in
its application, gracious in its <a name="page363"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 363</span>influence, and everlasting in its
results.&nbsp; Christ is riding in His chariot of salvation,
through the land of destruction, and death, clothed in the
majesty of mercy, and offering eternal life to all who will
believe.&nbsp; O captives of evil! now is the accepted time; now
is the day of salvation; now is the year of Jubilee; now is the
age of deliverance; now is &ldquo;the time of
reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; All the prophets speak of something within the veil,
to be manifested in due time; the advent of a Divine agent in a
future age, to accomplish a glorious
&ldquo;reformation.&rdquo;&nbsp; They represent him as a prince,
a hero, a high priest, a branch growing out of dry ground, a
child toying with the asp, and the lion, and leading the wolf,
and the lamb together.&nbsp; The bill of the reformation had been
repeatedly read by the prophets, and its passage required the
descent of the Lord from heaven.&nbsp; None but Himself could
effect the change of the dispensation.&nbsp; None but Himself had
the authority and the power to remove the first, and establish
the second.&nbsp; He whose voice once shook the earth, speaks
again, and heaven is shaken.&nbsp; He whose footsteps once
kindled Sinai into flame, descends again, and Calvary is red with
blood.&nbsp; The God of the ancient covenant introduces anew,
which is to abide for ever.&nbsp; The Lord of the temple alone
could change the furniture, and the service from the original
pattern shown to Moses on the mount; and six days before the
rending of the veil, significant of abrogation of the old
ceremonial, Moses came down upon a mountain in Palestine to
deliver up the pattern to Him of whom he had received it on
Sinai, that He might nail it to the cross on Calvary; for the
&ldquo;gifts and sacrifices&rdquo; belonging to the legal
dispensation, &ldquo;could not make him that did the service
perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; which stood only in
meats, and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances,
imposed on them until the time of reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reformation signifieth &ldquo;the removal of those things
that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things <a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>which
cannot be shaken may remain;&rdquo; the abrogation of
&ldquo;carnal ordinances,&rdquo; which were local, and temporal
in their nature, to make room for a spiritual worship, of
universal, and perpetual adaptation.&nbsp; Henceforth the blood
of bulls, and goats is superseded by the great reconciling
sacrifice of the Lamb of God, and outward forms, and ceremonies
give place to the inward operations of a renovating, and
purifying Spirit.</p>
<p>To the Jewish Church, the covenant of Sinai was a sort of
starry heaven.&nbsp; The Shekinah was its sun; the holy
festivals, its moon; and prophets, priests, and kings, its
stars.&nbsp; But Messiah, when He came, shook them all from their
spheres, and filled the firmament Himself.&nbsp; He is our
&ldquo;Bright and Morning Star;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sun of
Righteousness,&rdquo; rising upon us &ldquo;with healing in His
wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old covenant was an accuser, and a judge, but offered no
pardon to the guilty.&nbsp; It revealed the corruption of the
natural heart, but provided no renovating, and sanctifying
grace.&nbsp; It was a natural institution, for special benefit of
the seed of Abraham.&nbsp; It was a small vessel, trading only
with the land of Canaan.&nbsp; It secured, to a few, the temporal
blessings of the promised possession, but never delivered a
single soul from eternal death, never bore a single soul over to
the heavenly inheritance.&nbsp; But the new covenant is a
covenant of grace, and mercy, proffering forgiveness, and a clean
heart, not on the ground of any carnal relationship, but solely
through faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Christianity is a personal
concern between each man, and his God, and none but the penitent
believer has any right to its spiritual privileges.&nbsp; It is
adapted to Gentiles, as well as Jews, &ldquo;even as many as the
Lord our God shall call.&rdquo;&nbsp; Already has it rescued
myriads from the bondage of sin, and conveyed them over to the
land of immortality; and its voyages of grace shall continue to
the end of time, &ldquo;bringing many sons to glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old things are passed away, and all things are become
<a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>new.&rdquo;&nbsp; The circumcision of the flesh, made
with hands, has given place to the circumcision of the heart by
the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The Shekinah has departed from Mount Zion,
but its glory is illuminating the world.&nbsp; The Sword of
Joshua is returned to its scabbard; and &ldquo;the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God,&rdquo; issues from the mouth of
Messiah, and subdues the people under Him.&nbsp; The glorious
High-priesthood of Christ has superseded sacerdotal office among
men.&nbsp; Aaron was removed from the altar by death before his
work was finished; but our High-priest still wears His
sacrificial vestments, and death hath established Him before the
mercy-seat, &ldquo;a Priest for ever, after the order of
Melchisedec.&rdquo;&nbsp; The earthquake which shook Mount
Calvary, and rent the veil of the temple, demolished &ldquo;the
middle wall of partition&rdquo; between Jews and Gentiles.&nbsp;
The incense which Jesus offered fills the temple, and the land of
Judea cannot confine its fragrance.&nbsp; The fountain which
burst forth in Jerusalem, has sent out its living streams into
every land; and the heat of summer cannot dry them up, nor the
frosts of winter congeal them.</p>
<p>In short, all the vessels of the sanctuary are taken away by
the Lord of the temple.&nbsp; The &ldquo;twelve oxen,&rdquo;
bearing the &ldquo;molten sea,&rdquo; have given place to
&ldquo;the twelve Apostles of the Lamb,&rdquo; proclaiming
&ldquo;the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sprinkled mercy-seat, with its
over-shadowing, and intensely-gazing cherubim, has given place to
&ldquo;the throne of grace,&rdquo; stained with the blood of a
costlier sacrifice, into which the angels desire to look.&nbsp;
The priest, the altar, the burnt-offering, the table of
shew-bread, and the golden candlestick, have given place to the
better things of the new dispensation introduced by the Son of
God, of which they were only the figures, and the types.&nbsp;
Behold, the glory has gone up from the temple, and rests upon
Jesus on Mount Tabor; and Moses, and Elias are there, with Peter,
and James, and John; and the representatives of the old covenant
are communing with the Apostles <a name="page366"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 366</span>of the new, and the transfigured
Christ is the medium of the communication; and a voice of
majestic music, issuing from &ldquo;the excellent glory,&rdquo;
proclaims&mdash;&ldquo;This is my beloved Son, hear ye
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners spake
unto our fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
unto us by His Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Behold Him nailed to the Cross,
and hear Him cry&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
voice which shook Sinai is shaking Calvary.&nbsp; Heaven and hell
are in conflict, and earth trembles at the shock of battle.&nbsp;
The Prince of Life expires, and the sun puts on his robes of
mourning.&nbsp; Gabriel! descend from heaven, and explain to us
the wondrous emblem!&nbsp; As set the sun at noon on Golgotha,
making preternatural night throughout the land of Palestine, so
shall the empire of sin, and death be darkened, and their light
shall be quenched at meridian.&nbsp; As the Sun of Righteousness,
rising from the night of the grave on the third morning, brings
life, and immortality to light; so shall &ldquo;the day-spring
from on high&rdquo; yet dawn upon our gloomy vale, and &ldquo;the
power of His resurrection&rdquo; shall reanimate the dust of
every cemetery!</p>
<p>He that sitteth upon the throne hath
spoken&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, I make all things new.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The reformation includes not only the abrogation of the old, but
also the introduction of the new.&nbsp; It gives us a new
Mediator, a new covenant of grace, a new way of salvation, a new
heart of flesh, a new heaven and a new earth.&nbsp; It has
established a new union, by a new medium, between God, and
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Forasmuch as
the children were partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself
likewise took part of the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up
into glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was a new thing under the sun; the
&ldquo;Son of man&rdquo; bearing the &ldquo;express <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>image&rdquo; of the living God; bearing it untarnished
through the world; through the temptations and sorrows of such a
wilderness as humanity never trod before; through the unknown
agony of Olivet, and the supernatural gloom of Golgotha, and the
dark dominion of the king of terrors: to the Heaven of heavens;
where He sits, the adorable representative of two worlds, the
union of God and man!&nbsp; Thence He sends forth the Holy
Spirit, to collect &ldquo;the travail of His soul,&rdquo; and
lead them into all truth, and bring them to Zion with songs of
everlasting joy.&nbsp; See them, the redeemed of the Lord,
flocking as returning doves upon the wing, &ldquo;to the heavenly
Jerusalem, the city of the living God; and to the spirits of just
men made perfect; and to an innumerable company of angels; and to
Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant; and to the blood of
sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of
Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, join the joyful multitude! the year of jubilee is
come.&nbsp; The veil is rent asunder.&nbsp; The way into the
holiest is laid open.&nbsp; The blood of Jesus is on the
mercy-seat.&nbsp; The Lamb newly slain is in the midst of the
throne.&nbsp; Go ye, with boldness, into His gracious
presence.&nbsp; Lo, the King is your brother, and for you has He
stained His robe with blood!&nbsp; The robe alone can clothe your
naked souls, and shield them in the day of burning.&nbsp; Awake!
awake! put on the Lord Jesus Christ!&nbsp; The covenant of Sinai
cannot save you from wrath.&nbsp; Descent from Abraham cannot
entitle you to the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye must be
born again,&rdquo; &ldquo;born not of the flesh, nor of the will
of men, but of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; You must have a new heart, and
become a new creation in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This is the promise
of the Father,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the dear redeeming grace,<br />
For every sinner free.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many reformations have expired with the reformers.&nbsp; But
our Great Reformer &ldquo;ever liveth&rdquo; to carry on His
reformation, till His enemies become His footstool, and death and
hell <a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>are
cast into the lake of fire.&nbsp; He will finish the building of
His Church.&nbsp; When He laid &ldquo;the chief
corner-stone&rdquo; on Calvary, the shock jarred the earth, and
awoke the dead, and shook the nether world with terror; but when
He shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of
&ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; the dominion of Death and Hades shall
perish, and the last captive shall escape, and the song of the
bursting sepulchre shall be sweeter than the chorus of the
morning stars!&nbsp; Even now, there are new things in heaven;
the Lamb from the slaughter, alive &ldquo;in the midst of the
throne;&rdquo; worshipped by innumerable seraphim and cherubim,
and adored by the redeemed from earth; His name the wonder of
angels, the terror of devils, and the hope of men; His praise the
&ldquo;new song,&rdquo; which shall constitute the employment of
eternity!</p>
<h3>SERMON II.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Purification of the
Conscience</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>How much more shall the blood of
Christ</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>through the eternal Spirit</i>,
<i>offered Himself without spot to God</i>, <i>purge your
conscience from dead works to serve the living
God</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heb</span>. ix. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hebrew Christians, to whom the Apostle wrote, were well
acquainted with the laws of ceremonial purification by the blood
of beasts, and birds, for by blood almost everything was purified
in the service of the Temple.&nbsp; But it is only the blood of
Christ that can purge the human conscience.&nbsp; In speaking of
this purification, as presented in our text, let us
notice&mdash;<i>the object</i>, <i>the means</i>, and <i>the
end</i>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The object of this purification is the conscience;
which all the sacrificial blood shed, from the gate of Eden down
to the extinction of the fire on the Jewish altar, was not
sufficient to purge.</p>
<p><i>What is the conscience</i>?&nbsp; An inferior judge, the
representative of Jehovah, holding his court in the human soul;
according <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>to whose decision we feel either confidence, and joy in
God, or condemnation, and tormenting fear.&nbsp; His judicial
power is graduated by the degree of moral and evangelical light
which has been shed upon his palace.&nbsp; His knowledge of the
will, and character of God is the law by which he justifies, or
condemns.&nbsp; His intelligence is the measure of his authority;
and the perfection of knowledge would be the infallibility of
conscience.</p>
<p>This faithful recorder, and deputy judge is with us through
all the journey of life, and will accompany us with his register
over the river Jordan, whether to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom or the
society of the rich man in hell.&nbsp; While conscience keeps a
record on earth, Jehovah keeps a record in heaven; and when both
books shall be opened in the final judgment, there shall be found
a perfect correspondence.&nbsp; When temptations are presented,
the understanding opposes them, but the carnal mind indulges
them, and there is a contest between the judgment, and the will,
and we hesitate which to obey, till the warning bell of
conscience rings through the soul, and gives distinct notice of
his awful recognition; and when we turn away recklessly from his
faithful admonitions, we hear low mutterings of wrath stealing
along the avenues, and the quick sound of writing-pens in the
recording office, causing every denizen of the mental palace to
tremble.</p>
<p>There is a <i>good conscience</i>, <i>and an evil
conscience</i>.&nbsp; The work of both, however, is the same;
consisting in keeping a true record of the actions of men, and
passing sentence upon them according to their deserts.&nbsp;
Conscience is called good, or evil only with reference to the
character of its record, and its sentence.&nbsp; If the record is
one of virtues, and the sentence one of approval, the conscience
is good; if the record is one of vices, and the sentence one of
condemnation, the conscience is evil.</p>
<p>Some have a <i>guilty conscience</i>, that is, a conscience
that holds up to their view a black catalogue of crimes, and
rings <a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>in
their ears a sentence of condemnation.&nbsp; If you have such a
conscience, you are invited to Jesus, that you may find peace to
your souls.&nbsp; He is ever in His office, receiving all who
come, and blotting out, with His own blood, the handwriting which
is against them.</p>
<p>But some have a <i>despairing conscience</i>.&nbsp; They think
that their crimes are too great to be forgiven.&nbsp; The
registry of guilt, and the decree of death, hide from their eyes
the mercy of God, and the merit of Christ.&nbsp; Their sins rise
like mountains between them, and heaven.&nbsp; But let them look
away to Calvary.&nbsp; If their sins are a thousand times more
numerous than their tears, the blood of Jesus is ten thousand
times more powerful than their sins.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is able to
save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him, seeing He
ever liveth to make intercession for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And others have a <i>dark</i>, <i>and hardened
conscience</i>.&nbsp; They are so deceived, that they &ldquo;cry
peace, and safety, when destruction is at the door.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They are &ldquo;past feeling, having the conscience seared as
with a hot iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have sold themselves to work
evil; to eat sin like bread, and drink iniquity like water.&nbsp;
They have bribed, or gagged the recorder, and accuser within
them.&nbsp; They will betray the just cause of the righteous, and
slay the messengers of salvation, and think that they are doing
God service.&nbsp; John the Baptist is beheaded, that Herod may
keep his oath of honour.&nbsp; A dead fish cannot swim against
the stream; but if the king&rsquo;s conscience had been alive and
faithful, he would have said:&mdash;&ldquo;Girl, I promised to
give thee thy request, even to the half of my kingdom; but thou
hast requested too much; for the head of Messiah&rsquo;s herald
is more valuable than my whole kingdom, and all the kingdoms of
the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; But he had not the fear of God before his
eyes, and the proud fool sent, and beheaded the prophet in his
cell.</p>
<p>A <i>good conscience</i> is a faithful conscience, a lively
conscience, a peaceful conscience, a conscience void of offence
<a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>toward
God, and man, resting in the shadow of the cross, and assured of
an interest in His infinite merit.&nbsp; It is the victory of
faith unfeigned, working by love, and purifying the heart.&nbsp;
It is always found in the neighbourhood, and society of its
brethren, &ldquo;a broken heart and a contrite spirit;&rdquo; an
intense hatred of sin, and an ardent love of holiness; a spirit
of fervent prayer, and supplication, and a life of scrupulous
integrity, and charity; and above all, a humble confidence in the
mercy of God, through the mediation of Christ.&nbsp; These
constitute the brotherhood of Christianity; and wherever they
abound, a good conscience is never lacking.&nbsp; They are its
very element, and life; its food, its sunshine, and its vital
air.</p>
<p>Conscience was a faithful recorder, and judge under the law,
and notwithstanding the revolution which has taken place,
introducing a new constitution, and a new administration,
Conscience still retains his office; and when &ldquo;purged from
dead works to serve the living God,&rdquo; is appropriately
called a <i>good conscience</i>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The means of this purification is &ldquo;the blood
of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself without
spot to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could we take in, at a single view, all the bearings of
&ldquo;the blood of Christ,&rdquo; as exhibited in the Gospel,
what an astonishing light would it cast upon the condition of
man; the character of God; the nature, and requirements of His
law; the dreadful consequences of sin; the wondrous expiation of
the cross; the reconciliation of Heaven, and earth; the blessed
union of the believer with God in Christ, as a just God, and a
Saviour; and the whole scheme of our justification,
sanctification, and redemption, through free, sovereign,
infinite, and unspeakable grace!</p>
<p>There is no knowledge like the knowledge of Christ, for the
excellency of which the apostle counted all things but
loss.&nbsp; Christ is the Sun of Righteousness, in whose light we
see the tops of the mountains of immortality, towering <a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>above the
dense clouds which overhang the valley of death.&nbsp; All the
wisdom which philosophers have learned from nature, and
providence, compared with that which is afforded by the Christian
revelation, is like the <i>ignis fatuus</i>, compared with the
sun.&nbsp; The knowledge of Plato, and Socrates, and all the
renowned sages of antiquity, was nothing to the knowledge of the
feeblest believer in &ldquo;the blood of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; is of infinite value.&nbsp;
There is none like it flowing in human veins.&nbsp; It was the
blood of a man, but of a man who knew no iniquity; the blood of a
sinless humanity, in which dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily; the blood of the second Adam, who is the Lord from
Heaven, and a quickening Spirit upon earth.&nbsp; It pressed
through every pore of His body in the garden; and gushed from His
head, His hands, His feet, and His side, upon the cross.&nbsp; I
approach with fear, and trembling, yet with humble confidence,
and joy.&nbsp; I take off my shoes, like Moses, as he approaches
the burning bush; for I hear a voice coming forth from the altar,
saying, &ldquo;I and my Father are one; I am the true God, and
Eternal Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression, &ldquo;the blood of Christ,&rdquo; includes
the whole of His obedience to the moral law, by the imputation of
which we are justified; and all the sufferings of His soul and
His body as our Mediator, by which an atonement is made for our
sins, and a fountain opened to wash them all away.&nbsp; This is
the spring whence rise the rivers of forgiving and sanctifying
grace.</p>
<p>In the representation which the text gives us of this
redeeming blood, are several points worthy of our special
consideration:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;<i>the blood of Christ</i>;&rdquo; the
appointed Substitute and Saviour of men; &ldquo;the Lamb that
taketh away the sins of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, <i>who offered
Himself</i>.&nbsp; His humanity was the only sacrifice which
would answer the demands of justice, and atone for the
transgressions of mankind.&nbsp; <a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>Therefore &ldquo;He has made His
soul an offering for sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered Himself <i>to
God</i>.&nbsp; It was the eternal Father, whose broken law must
be repaired, whose dishonest government must be vindicated, and
whose flaming indignation must be turned away.&nbsp; The
well-beloved Son must meet the Father&rsquo;s frown, and bear the
Father&rsquo;s curse for us.&nbsp; All the Divine attributes
called for the offering; and without it, could not be reconciled
to the sinner.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered Himself to
God, <i>without spot</i>.&nbsp; This was a perfect
sacrifice.&nbsp; The Victim was without blemish, or defect; the
altar was complete in all its appurtenances; and the High Priest
possessed every conceivable qualification for his work.&nbsp;
Christ was at once victim, altar, and high-priest; &ldquo;holy,
harmless, and undefiled&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God manifest in the
flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being Himself perfect God and perfect man,
and perfect Mediator between God and man, He perfects for ever
all them that believe.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered Himself to
God, without spot, <i>through the eternal Spirit</i>.&nbsp; By
the eternal Spirit, here, we are to understand, not the third
Person of the Godhead, but the second; Christ&rsquo;s own Divine
nature, which was co-eternal with the Father before the world
was, and which, in the fulness of time, seized on
humanity&mdash;sinless, and immaculate humanity&mdash;and offered
it, body, and soul, as a sacrifice for human sins.&nbsp; The
eternal Spirit was at once the priest that offered the victim,
and the altar that sanctified the offering.&nbsp; Without His
agency, there could have been no atonement.&nbsp; The offering of
mere humanity, however spotless, aside from the merit derived
from its connection with Divinity, could not have been a
sacrifice of sweet-smelling savour unto God.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered Himself to
God, without spot, through the eternal Spirit, <i>that He might
purge your conscience</i>.&nbsp; As the typical sacrifices under
<a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 374</span>the law
purified men from ceremonial defilement, so the real sacrifice of
the Gospel saves the believer from moral pollution.&nbsp; Blood
was the life of all the services of the tabernacle made with
hands, and gave significance, and utility to all the rites of the
former dispensation.&nbsp; By blood the covenant between God, and
His people was sealed.&nbsp; By blood the officers, and vessels
of the sanctuary were consecrated.&nbsp; By blood the children of
Israel were preserved in Egypt from the destroying angel.&nbsp;
So the blood of Christ is our justification, sanctification, and
redemption.&nbsp; All the blessings of the Gospel flow to us
through the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; Mercy, when she writes our
pardon, and when she registers our names in &ldquo;the Book of
Life,&rdquo; dips her pen in the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; And the
vast company that John saw before the throne had come out of
great tribulation, having &ldquo;washed their robes and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children of Israel were delivered from Egypt, on the very
night that the paschal lamb was slain, and its blood sprinkled
upon the doorposts, as if their liberty, and life were procured
by its death.&nbsp; This typified the necessity, and power of the
Atonement, which is the very heart of the Gospel, and the
spiritual life of the believer.&nbsp; In Egypt, however, there
was a lamb slain for every family; but under the new covenant God
has but one family, and one Lamb is sufficient for their
salvation.</p>
<p>In the cleansing of the leper, several things were necessary;
as running water, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop, and the finger
of the priest; but it was the blood that gave efficacy to the
whole.&nbsp; So it is in the purification of the
conscience.&nbsp; Without the shedding of blood, the leper could
not be cleansed; without the shedding of blood, the conscience
cannot be purged.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; seals
every precept, every promise, every warning, of the New
Testament.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; renders the
Scriptures &ldquo;profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>in righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; gives efficiency to the pulpit;
and when &ldquo;Jesus Christ and Him crucified&rdquo; is shut
out, the virtue is wanting which heals, and restores the
soul.&nbsp; It is only through the crucifixion of Christ that
&ldquo;the old man&rdquo; is crucified in the believer.&nbsp; It
is only through His obedience unto death, even the death of the
cross, that our dead souls are quickened, to serve God in newness
of life.</p>
<p>Here rest our hopes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The foundation of God
standeth sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bill of redemption being
presented by Christ, was read by the prophets, and passed
unanimously in both houses of parliament.&nbsp; It had its final
reading in the lower house, when Messiah hung on Calvary; and
passed three days afterward, when He rose from the dead.&nbsp; It
was introduced to the upper house by the Son of God Himself, who
appeared before the throne &ldquo;as a lamb newly slain,&rdquo;
and was carried by acclamation of the heavenly hosts.&nbsp; Then
it became a law of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Holy Ghost was
sent down to establish it in the hearts of men.&nbsp; It is
&ldquo;the perfect law of liberty,&rdquo; by which God is
reconciling the world unto Himself.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the law of
the Spirit of life,&rdquo; by which He is &ldquo;purging our
conscience from dead works to serve the living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; The end of this purification is twofold,&mdash;that
we may cease from dead works, and serve the living God.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The works of unrenewed souls are all &ldquo;dead
works,&rdquo; can be no other than &ldquo;dead works,&rdquo;
because the agents are &ldquo;dead in trespasses and
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; They proceed from the &ldquo;carnal
mind,&rdquo; which &ldquo;is enmity against God,&rdquo; which
&ldquo;is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; How can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,
or a corrupt fountain send forth pure water?</p>
<p>But &ldquo;the blood of Christ&rdquo; is intended to
&ldquo;purge the conscience from dead works.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
apostle says&mdash;&ldquo;Ye are not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver, and gold, from your vain conversation,
received by tradition from your <a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>fathers; but with the precious blood
of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without
spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jews were in a state of bondage to the
ceremonial law, toiling at the &ldquo;dead works,&rdquo; the
vain, and empty forms, which could never take away sin; and
unjustified, and unregenerate men are still captives of Satan,
slaves of sin, and death, tyrannized over by various evil habits,
and propensities, which are invincible to all things but
&ldquo;the blood of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died to redeem, both
from the burdens of the Mosaic ritual, and from the despotism of
moral evil&mdash;to purge the conscience of both Jew, and Gentile
&ldquo;from dead works to serve the living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We cannot &ldquo;serve the living God&rdquo; without
this preparatory purification of conscience.&nbsp; If our guilt
is uncancelled&mdash;if the love of sin is not
dethroned&mdash;the service of the knee, and the lip is nothing
but hypocrisy.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we regard iniquity in our hearts,
the Lord will not hear us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cherishing what He hates,
all our offerings are an abomination to Him; and we can no more
stand in His holy presence than the dry stubble can stand before
a flaming fire.&nbsp; He who has an evil conscience flees from
the face of God, as did Adam in the garden.&nbsp; Nothing but
&ldquo;the blood of Christ,&rdquo; applied by the Holy Spirit,
can remove the sinner&rsquo;s guilty fear, and enable him to draw
nigh to God, in the humble confidence of acceptance through the
Beloved.</p>
<p>The service of the living God must flow from a new principle
of life in the soul.&nbsp; The Divine word must be the rule of
our actions.&nbsp; The Divine will must be consulted and
obeyed.&nbsp; We must remember that God is holy, and jealous of
His honour.&nbsp; The consideration that He is everywhere, and
sees everything, and will bring every work into judgment, must
fill us with reverence and godly fear.&nbsp; An ardent love for
His law, and His character must supplant the love of sin, and
prompt to a cheerful and impartial obedience.</p>
<p>And let us remember that he is &ldquo;the <i>living</i>
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pharaoh is dead, Herod is dead, Nero is dead;
but Jehovah is &ldquo;the living God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is a
fearful thing <a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>to have Him for an enemy.&nbsp; Death cannot deliver
from His hand.&nbsp; Time, and even eternity, cannot limit His
holy anger.&nbsp; He has manifested, in a thousand instances, His
hatred of sin: in the destruction of the old world, the burning
of Sodom, and Gomorrah, the drowning of Pharaoh and his host in
the sea; and I tell thee, sinner, except thou repent, thou shalt
likewise perish!&nbsp; Oh, think what punishment &ldquo;the
living God&rdquo; can inflict upon His adversaries&mdash;the loss
of all good&mdash;the endurance of all evil&mdash;the undying
worm&mdash;the unquenchable fire&mdash;the blackness of darkness
for ever!</p>
<p>The gods of the heathen have no life in them, and they that
worship them are like unto them.&nbsp; But our God is &ldquo;the
living God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the God of the living.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If you are united to Him by faith in &ldquo;the blood of
Christ,&rdquo; your souls are &ldquo;quickened together with
Him,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the power which raised Him from the dead
shall also quicken your mortal body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the Lord awaken those who are dead in trespasses, and
sins, and revive His work in the midst of the years, and
strengthen the feeble graces of His people, and bless abundantly
the labours of His servants, so that many consciences may be
purged from dead works to serve the living God!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a fountain filled with blood,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn from Emmanuel&rsquo;s veins,<br />
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lose all their guilty stains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dying thief rejoiced to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fountain in his day;<br />
And there may I, as vile as he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash all my sins away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear dying Lamb! Thy precious blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall never lose its power,<br />
Till all the ransomed sons of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are saved, to sin no more.&rdquo;</p>

378</span>SERMON III.<br />
<span class="smcap">Finished Redemption</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>It is finished</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">John</span> xix. 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This exclamation derives all its importance from the magnitude
of the work alluded to, and the glorious character of the
Agent.&nbsp; The work is the redemption of the world; the Agent
is God, manifested in the flesh.&nbsp; He who finished the
creation of the heavens, and the earth in six days, is laying the
foundation of a new creation on Calvary.&nbsp; Four thousand
years He has been giving notice of His intention to mankind; more
than thirty years He has been personally upon earth, preparing
the material; and now He lays the chief corner-stone in Zion,
exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will consider the special import of the exclamation, and
then offer a few remarks of a more general character.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;&nbsp; This saying of
the Son of God is a very striking one; and, uttered, as it was,
while He hung in dying agonies on the cross, cannot fail to make
a strong impression upon the mind.&nbsp; It is natural for us to
inquire&mdash;&ldquo;What does it mean?&nbsp; To what does the
glorious Victim refer?&rdquo;&nbsp; A complete answer to the
question would develope the whole scheme of redemption.&nbsp; We
can only glance at a few leading ideas.</p>
<p>The sufferings of Christ are ended.&nbsp; Never again shall He
be persecuted from city to city, as an impostor, and servant of
Satan.&nbsp; Never again shall He say, &ldquo;My soul is
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never again
shall He agonize in Gethsemane, and sweat great drops of
blood.&nbsp; Never again shall He be derided by the rabble, and
insulted by men in power.&nbsp; Never again shall He be crowned
with thorns, lacerated by the scourge, and nailed to the accursed
tree.&nbsp; Never again shall He cry out, in the anguish of His
<a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>soul,
and the baptism of blood&mdash;&ldquo;My God! my God! why hast
Thou forsaken me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The predictions of His death are fulfilled.&nbsp; The prophets
had spoken of His crucifixion many hundred years before His
birth.&nbsp; They foresaw the Governor who was to come forth from
Bethlehem.&nbsp; They knew the Babe in the manger, as He whose
goings forth are of old, even from everlasting.&nbsp; They drew
an accurate chart of His travels, from the manger to the cross,
and from the cross to the throne.&nbsp; All these things must be
fulfilled.&nbsp; Jesus knew the necessity, and seemed anxious
that every jot, and tittle should receive an exact
accomplishment.&nbsp; His whole life was a fulfilment of
prophecy.&nbsp; On every path He walked, on every house He
entered, on every city He visited, and especially on the
mysterious phenomena which accompanied His crucifixion, it was
written&mdash;&ldquo;that the Scriptures might be
fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great sacrifice for sin is accomplished.&nbsp; For this
purpose Christ came into the world.&nbsp; He is our appointed
High Priest, the elect of the Father, and the desire of the
nations.&nbsp; He alone was in the bosom of the Father, and could
offer a sacrifice of sufficient merit to atone for human
transgression.&nbsp; But it was necessary also that He should
have somewhat to offer.&nbsp; Therefore a body was prepared for
Him.&nbsp; He assumed the seed of Abraham, and suffered in the
flesh.&nbsp; This was a sacrifice of infinite value, being
sanctified by the altar of Divinity on which it was
offered.&nbsp; All the ceremonial sacrifices could not obtain the
bond from the hand of the creditor.&nbsp; They were only
acknowledgment of the debt.&nbsp; But Jesus, by one offering,
paid the whole, took up the bond, the hand-writing that was
against us, and nailed it to the cross; and when driving the last
nail, He cried&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The satisfaction of Divine justice is completed.&nbsp; The
violated law must be vindicated; the deserved penalty must be
endured; if not by the sinner himself, yet by the sinner&rsquo;s
Substitute.&nbsp; This was the great undertaking of the <a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>Son of
God.&nbsp; He &ldquo;bore our sins&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the
punishment of our sins&mdash;&ldquo;in His own body on the
tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was &ldquo;made a curse for us, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was no other way by which the honour of God and the dignity of
His law could be sustained, and therefore &ldquo;the Lord laid
upon Him the iniquities of us all.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;died
unto sin once;&rdquo; not merely for sin, enduring its punishment
in our stead; but also &ldquo;unto sin,&rdquo; abolishing its
power, and putting it away.&nbsp; Therefore it is said, He
&ldquo;made an end of sin&rdquo;&mdash;destroyed its condemning,
and tormenting power on behalf of all them that believe His
sufferings were equal to the claims of justice; and His dying cry
was the voice of Justice Himself proclaiming the
satisfaction.&nbsp; Here, then, may the dying thief, and the
persecutor of the holy, lay down their load of guilt, and woe at
the foot of the cross.</p>
<p>The new, and living way to God is consecrated.&nbsp; A veil
has hitherto concealed the holy of holies.&nbsp; None but the
High Priest has seen the ark of the covenant, and the glory of
God resting upon the Mercy-seat between the cherubim.&nbsp; He
alone might enter, and he but once a year, and then with fear,
and trembling, and the sprinkling of atoning blood, after the
most careful purification, and sacrifice for himself.&nbsp; He
has filled His hands with His own blood, and entered into heaven
itself, there to appear in the presence of God for us.&nbsp; The
sweet incense which He offers fills the temple, and the merit of
His sacrifice remains the same through all time, superseding all
other offerings for ever.&nbsp; Therefore we are exhorted to come
boldly to the throne of grace.&nbsp; The tunnel under the Thames
could not be completed on account of an accident which greatly
damaged the work, without a new subscription for raising money;
but Jesus found infinite riches in Himself, sufficient for the
completion of a new way to the Father&mdash;a living way through
the valley of the shadow of death to &ldquo;the city of the Great
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conquest of the powers of darkness is achieved.&nbsp; <a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>When their
hour was come, the prince and his host were on the alert to
accomplish the destruction of the Son of God.&nbsp; They hailed
Him with peculiar temptations, and levelled against Him their
heaviest artillery.&nbsp; They instigated one disciple to betray
Him and another to deny Him.&nbsp; They fired the rage of the
multitude against Him, so that the same tongues that lately sang,
&ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; now shouted,
&ldquo;Crucify Him! crucify Him!&rdquo;&nbsp; They filled the
priests, and scribes with envy, that they might accuse Him
without a cause; and inspired Pilate with an accursed ambition,
that he might condemn him without a fault.&nbsp; They seared the
conscience of the false witnesses, that they might charge the
Just One with the most flagrant crimes; and cauterized the hearts
of the Roman soldiers, that they might mock Him in His
sufferings, and nail Him to the cross.&nbsp; Having succeeded so
far in their hellish plot, they doubtless deemed their victory
certain.&nbsp; I see them crowding around the cross, waiting
impatiently to witness his last breath, ready to shout with
infernal triumph to the depths of hell, till the brazen walls
should send back their echoes to the gates of the heavenly
city.&nbsp; But hark! the dying Saviour exclaims&mdash;&ldquo;It
is finished!&rdquo; and the great dragon and his host retreat,
howling, from the cross.&nbsp; The Prince of our Salvation turned
back all their artillery upon themselves, and their own
stratagems became their ruin.&nbsp; The old serpent seized
Messiah&rsquo;s heel, but Messiah stamped upon the
serpent&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The dying cry of Jesus shook the
dominions of death, so that the bodies of many that slept arose;
and rang through all the depths of hell the knell of its departed
power.&nbsp; Thus the Prince of this world was foiled in His
schemes, and disappointed in his hopes, like the men of Gaza,
when they locked up Samson at night, thinking to kill him in the
morning: but awoke to find that he was gone, with the gates of
the city upon his shoulders.&nbsp; When the Philistines caught
Samson, and brought him to their Temple, to make sport for them,
they never dreamed of the disaster in <a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>which it would result&mdash;never
dreamed that their triumph over the poor blind captive would be
the occasion of their destruction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suffer me,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;to lean on the two pillars.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he
bowed himself, and died with his enemies.&nbsp; So Christ on
Calvary, while the powers of darkness exulted over their victim,
seized the main pillars of sin, and death, and brought down the
temple of Satan upon its occupants; but on the morning of the
third day, He left them all in the ruins, where they shall remain
for ever, and commenced His journey home to His Father&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; So much concerning the import of our Saviour&rsquo;s
exclamation.&nbsp; Such was the work He finished upon the
cross.&nbsp; We add a few remarks of a more general
character.</p>
<p>The sufferings of Christ were vicarious.&nbsp; He died, not
for His own sins, but for ours.&nbsp; He humbled Himself, that we
might be exalted.&nbsp; He became poor, that we might be made
rich.&nbsp; He was wounded, that we might be healed.&nbsp; He
drained the cup of wrath, that we might drink the waters of
salvation.&nbsp; He died the shameful and excruciating death of
the cross, that we might live and reign with Him for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to
have entered into His glory?&rdquo;&nbsp; This
&ldquo;ought&rdquo; is the ought of mercy, and of covenant
engagement.&nbsp; He must discharge the obligation which He had
voluntarily assumed.&nbsp; He must finish the work which He had
graciously begun.&nbsp; There was no other Saviour&mdash;no other
being in the universe willing to undertake the work; or, if any
willing to undertake, none able to accomplish it.&nbsp; The
salvation of one human soul would have been too mighty an
achievement for Gabriel&mdash;for all the angels in heaven.&nbsp;
Had not &ldquo;the only-begotten of the Father&rdquo; become our
Surety, we must have lain for ever under the wrath of God, amid
&ldquo;weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
None but the Lion of the tribe of Judah could break the seals of
that mysterious book.&nbsp; None but &ldquo;God manifest in the
flesh&rdquo; could deliver us from the second death.</p>
<p><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>The
dying cry of Jesus indicates the dignity of His nature, and the
power of life that was in Him to the last.&nbsp; All men die of
weakness&mdash;of inability to resist death&mdash;die because
they can live no longer.&nbsp; But this was not the case with the
Son of God.&nbsp; He speaks of laying down His life as His own
voluntary act;&mdash;&ldquo;No man taketh it from He, but I lie
it down of myself.&nbsp; I have power to lay it down, and I have
power to take it again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He poured out His
soul unto death&rdquo;&mdash;did not wait for it to be torn from
Him&mdash;did not hang languishing upon the cross, till life
&ldquo;ebbed out by slow degrees;&rdquo; but poured it out
freely, suddenly, and unexpectedly.&nbsp; As soon as the work was
done for which He came into the world, He cried&mdash;&ldquo;It
is finished!&rdquo; &ldquo;bowed His head, and gave up the
ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the sun was darkened, the earth quaked,
the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the centurion
said&mdash;&ldquo;Truly, this Man was the Son of
God!&rdquo;&nbsp; He cried with a loud voice, to show that He was
still unconquered by pain, mighty even upon the cross.&nbsp; He
bowed His head that death might seize Him.&nbsp; He was naturally
far above the reach of death, His Divine nature being
self-existent and eternal, and His human nature entitled to
immortality by its immaculate holiness; yet &ldquo;He humbled
Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He bowed His head, and gave up the
ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may regard this last exclamation, also, as an expression of
His joy at having accomplished the great &ldquo;travail of his
soul,&rdquo; in the work of our redemption.&nbsp; It was the work
which the Father had given Him, and which He had covenanted to
do.&nbsp; It lay heavy upon His heart, and oh, how was He
straitened till it was accomplished!&nbsp; His &ldquo;soul was
exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death;&rdquo; &ldquo;and His
sweat, as it were, great drops of blood, falling down to the
ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; But upon the cross, He saw of the travail of
His soul, and was satisfied.&nbsp; He saw that His sacrifice was
accepted, and the object of His agony secured&mdash;that death
would not be <a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>able to detain Him in the grave, nor hell to defeat the
purpose of His grace; that the gates of the eternal city would
soon open to receive Him as a conqueror, and myriads of exultant
angels shout Him to His throne; whither He would be followed by
His redeemed, with songs of everlasting joy.&nbsp; He saw, and He
was satisfied; and, not waiting for the morning of the third day,
but already confident of victory, He uttered this note of
triumph, and died.</p>
<p>And if we may suppose them to have understood its import, what
a source of consolation it must have been to His sorrowing
disciples!&nbsp; The sword had pierced through Mary&rsquo;s
heart, according to the prediction of old Simeon over the infant
Jesus.&nbsp; Her affections had bled at the agony of her
supernatural Son, and her wounded faith had well-nigh perished at
His cross.&nbsp; And how must all His followers have felt,
standing afar off, and beholding their supposed Redeemer
suffering as a malefactor!&nbsp; How must all their hopes have
died within them, as they gazed on the accursed tree!&nbsp; The
tragedy was mysterious, and they deemed their enemies
victorious.&nbsp; Jesus is treading the winepress in Bozrah, and
the earth is shaking, and the rocks are rending, and the
luminaries of heaven are expiring, and all the powers of nature
are fainting, in sympathy with His mighty agony.&nbsp; Now he is
lost in the fire, and smoke of battle, and the dread artillery of
justice is heard thundering through the thick darkness, and
shouts of victory rise from the troops of hell, and who shall
foretell the issue of the combat, or the fate of the
Champion?&nbsp; But lo!&nbsp; He cometh forth from the cloud of
battle, with blood upon His garments!&nbsp; He is wounded, but He
hath the tread, and the aspect of a conqueror.&nbsp; He waves His
crimsoned sword, and cries&mdash;&ldquo;It is
finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; Courage, ye weepers at the cross!&nbsp;
Courage, ye tremblers afar off!&nbsp; The Prince of your
salvation is victor, and this bulletin of the war shall cheer
myriads of believers in the house of their pilgrimage, and the
achievement which it announces shall constitute an everlasting
theme of praise.</p>
<p><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; The word smote on
the walls of the celestial city, and thrilled the hosts of heaven
with ecstasy unspeakable.&nbsp; How must &ldquo;the spirits of
just men made perfect&rdquo; have leaped for joy, to hear that
the Captain of their salvation was victorious over all His
enemies, and that the work He had engaged to do for them, and
their brethren was completed!&nbsp; And with what wonder, and
delight must the holy angels have witnessed the triumph of Him,
whom they were commanded to worship, over the powers of
darkness!&nbsp; It was the commencement of a new era in heaven,
and never before had its happy denizens seen so much of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; Go, ye heralds of
salvation, into all the world, and proclaim the joyful
tidings!&nbsp; Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up your voice like
a trumpet, and publish, to all men, that the work of the cross is
finished&mdash;that the Great Mediator, &ldquo;made perfect
through sufferings,&rdquo; has become &ldquo;the author of
eternal salvation to all them that obey
Him&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;is of God made unto us, wisdom, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Go, teach the degraded pagan, the deluded Mohammedan, and the
superstitious Papist, that the finished work of Jesus is the only
way of acceptance with God.&nbsp; Go, tell the polished scholar,
the profound philosopher, and the vaunting moralist, that the
doctrine of Christ crucified is the only knowledge that can save
the soul!&nbsp; Go,&mdash;say to the proud sceptic, the bold
blasphemer, and the polluted libertine, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of
God that taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Preach it
to the gasping sinner upon the death-bed, and the sullen murderer
in his cell!&nbsp; Let it ring in every human ear, and thrill in
every human heart, till the gladness of earth shall be the
counterpart of heaven!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The wonderful Providence, which brought the children of Israel
out of the house of bondage, was a chain of many links, not one
of which could be omitted without destroying the beauty, and
defeating the end of the Divine economy.&nbsp; The family of
Jacob came to Egypt in the time of famine&mdash;they
multiply&mdash;they are oppressed&mdash;their cries reach to
heaven&mdash;God manifests Himself in the burning
bush&mdash;Moses is sent to Egypt&mdash;miracles are wrought by
his hand&mdash;Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is hardened&mdash;the
firstborn are slain&mdash;the passover is eaten&mdash;the people
depart, led by the pillar of God&mdash;the sea is
divided&mdash;and, with many signs, and wonders, the thousands of
Israel are conducted through the wilderness to the Promised
Land.&nbsp; Had one of these links been wanting, the chain of
deliverance had been defective.</p>
<p>So, in the salvation of sinners by Jesus Christ, all the
conditions, and preparatives were essential to the completeness,
and glory of the scheme.&nbsp; The Son of God must consent to
undertake our cause, and become our substitute&mdash;the promise
must be given to Adam, and frequently repeated to the
patriarchs&mdash;bloody sacrifices must be instituted, to typify
the vicarious sufferings of Messiah&mdash;a long line of prophets
must foretell His advent, and the glory of His kingdom&mdash;He
must be born in Bethlehem, crucified on Calvary, and buried in
Joseph&rsquo;s new tomb&mdash;must rise from the dead, ascend to
the right hand of the Father, and send down the Holy Spirit to
guide and sanctify His Church.&nbsp; <a name="page387"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 387</span>Without all these circumstances, the
economy of redemption would have been incomplete and
inefficient.</p>
<p>The last link in the chain is the mission and work of the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; This is quite as important as any of the
rest.&nbsp; Our Saviour&rsquo;s heart seems to have been much set
upon it, during all His ministry, and especially during the last
few days, before His crucifixion.&nbsp; He spoke of it,
frequently, to His disciples, and told them that He would not
leave them comfortless, but would send them &ldquo;another
Comforter,&rdquo; who should abide with them for ever; and that
His own departure was necessary, to prepare the way for the
coming of the heavenly Paraclete.&nbsp; In our text, He describes
the office of the Holy Spirit, and the specific relation which He
sustains to the work of Salvation:&mdash;&ldquo;Howbeit, when He,
the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth;
for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear,
that shall He speak; and He will show you things to come.&nbsp;
He shall glorify me: for He shall receive of mine, and shall show
it unto you.&nbsp; All things that the Father hath are mine;
therefore said I, that He shall take of mine, and shall show it
unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words teach us two important truths&mdash;<i>first</i>,
that the Son is equal with the Father; and, <i>secondly</i>, that
the Father, and the Son are alike glorified in the economy of
salvation.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Son claims equality with the Father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All things that the Father hath are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentence is very comprehensive, and sublime&mdash;an
unquestionable affirmation of the Messiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;eternal
power, and Godhead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same doctrine is taught us,
in many other recorded sayings of Christ, and sustained by all
the prophets, and apostles; and when I consider this declaration,
in connection with the general strain of the inspired writers on
the subject, I seem to hear the Saviour Himself addressing the
world in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things that the Father hath are mine.&nbsp; His
<i>names</i> are mine.&nbsp; I am Jehovah&mdash;the mighty God,
and the everlasting <a name="page388"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 388</span>Father&mdash;the Lord of
Hosts&mdash;the Living God&mdash;the True God, and Eternal
Life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>works</i> are mine.&nbsp; All things were made
by me, and I uphold all things by the word of my power.&nbsp; My
Father worketh hitherto, and I work; for as the Father raiseth up
the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He
will.&nbsp; I am the Author of universal being, and my hand
moveth all the machinery of Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>honours</i> are mine.&nbsp; I have an
indisputable right to the homage of all created
intelligences.&nbsp; I inhabit the praises of Eternity.&nbsp;
Before the foundation of the world, I was the object of angelic
adoration; and when I became incarnate as a Saviour, the Father
published His decree in heaven, saying&mdash;&lsquo;Let all the
angels of God worship Him!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is His will, also,
that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
Father&mdash;in the same manner, and the same degree.&nbsp; He
that honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father; and he that
honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father: for I and my
Father are one&mdash;one in honour&mdash;possessing joint
interest, and authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>attributes</i> are mine.&nbsp; Though as man,
and Mediator I am inferior to the Father; yet my nature is no
more inferior to His, than the nature of the Prince of Wales is
inferior to the nature of the King of England.&nbsp; You see me
clothed in humanity; but, in my original state, I thought it not
robbery to be equal with God.&nbsp; I was in the beginning with
God, and possessed the same eternity of being.&nbsp; Like Him, I
am almighty, omniscient, and immutable; infinite in holiness,
justice, goodness, and truth.&nbsp; All these attributes, with
every other possible perfection, belong to me, in the same sense
as they belong to the Father.&nbsp; They are absolute, and
independent, underived, and unoriginated&mdash;the essential
qualities of my nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>riches of grace</i> are mine.&nbsp; I am the
Mediator of the new covenant&mdash;the Channel of my
Father&rsquo;s mercies to <a name="page389"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 389</span>mankind.&nbsp; I have the keys of
the House of David, and the seal of the Kingdom of Heaven.&nbsp;
I have come from the bosom of the Father, freighted with the
precious treasures of His good will to men.&nbsp; I have sailed
over the sea of tribulation, and death, to bring you the wealth
of the other world.&nbsp; I am the Father&rsquo;s Messenger,
publishing peace on earth&mdash;a peace which I have purchased
with my own blood upon the cross.&nbsp; It has pleased the Father
that in me all fulness should dwell&mdash;all fulness of wisdom,
and grace&mdash;whatever is necessary for the justification,
sanctification, and redemption of them that believe.&nbsp; My
Father, and I are one, in the work of salvation, as in the work
of creation.&nbsp; We have the same will, and the same intention
of mercy toward the children of the great captivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>objects of His love</i> are mine.&nbsp; He hath
given them to me in an everlasting covenant.&nbsp; He hath given
me the heathen for an inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for a possession.&nbsp; They were mine by the original
right of creation; but now they are doubly mine, by the
superadded claim of redemption.&nbsp; My Father, before the world
was, gave me a charter of all the souls I would redeem.&nbsp; I
have fulfilled the condition.&nbsp; I have poured out my soul
unto death, and sealed the covenant with the blood of my
cross.&nbsp; Therefore, all believers are mine.&nbsp; I have
bought them with a price.&nbsp; I have redeemed them from the
bondage of sin, and death.&nbsp; Their names are engraven on my
hands, and my feet.&nbsp; They are written with the
soldier&rsquo;s spear upon my heart.&nbsp; And of all that the
Father hath given me, I will lose nothing.&nbsp; I will draw them
all to myself; I will raise them up at the last day; and they
shall be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which
I had with the Father before the foundation of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The Father and the Son are equally glorified in the
economy of redemption, and the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Son glorifies the Father.&nbsp; I hear Him
praying in <a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>the garden:&mdash;&ldquo;Father, I have glorified Thee
on earth; I have finished the work which Thou gavest me to
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hear Him, again, amidst the supernatural gloom
of Calvary, with a voice that rings through the dominions of
death, and hell, crying&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What mighty achievement hast Thou finished to-day, blessed
Jesus? and how have Thine unknown agony, and shameful death
glorified the Father?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have glorified the Father, by raising up those
precious things which fell in Eden, and were lost in the
abyss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have raised up my Father&rsquo;s <i>law</i>.&nbsp; I
found it cast down to the earth, and trampled into the
dust.&nbsp; I have magnified, and found it honourable.&nbsp; I
have vindicated its authority in the sight of men, and
angels.&nbsp; I have satisfied its demands on behalf of my
redeemed, and become the end of the law for righteousness to all
who will receive me as their surety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have raised up my Father&rsquo;s <i>name</i>.&nbsp; I
have declared it to my brethren.&nbsp; I have manifested it to
the men whom He has given me.&nbsp; I have given a new revelation
of His character to the world.&nbsp; I have shown Him to sinners,
as a just God, and a Saviour.&nbsp; I have restored His worship
in purity, and spiritually upon earth.&nbsp; I have opened a new,
and living way to His throne of grace.&nbsp; I have written the
record of His mercy with my own blood upon the rocks of
Calvary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have raised up my Father&rsquo;s <i>image</i>.&nbsp;
I have imprinted it afresh upon human nature, from which it was
effaced by sin.&nbsp; I have displayed its excellence in my own
character.&nbsp; I have passed through the pollutions of the
world, and the territory of death, without tarnishing its lustre,
or injuring its symmetry.&nbsp; Though my visage is marred with
grief, and my back ploughed with scourges, and my hands, and feet
nailed to the accursed cross, not one trace of my Father&rsquo;s
image has been obliterated from my human soul.&nbsp; It is as
perfect, and as spotless now as when I lay in the manger.&nbsp; I
will carry it unstained with me into heaven.&nbsp; I will give a
full description of it in my Gospel upon earth.&nbsp; I will <a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>change my
people into the same image, from glory, to glory.&nbsp; I will
also renovate, and transform their vile bodies, and fashion them
like unto my own glorious body.&nbsp; I will ransom them from the
power of the grave; and because I live, they shall live
also&mdash;the counterpart of my own immaculate
humanity&mdash;mirrors to reflect my Father&rsquo;s glory for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Father glorifies the Son.&nbsp; He prayed in the
garden,&mdash;&ldquo;And now, Father, glorify Thou me with Thine
own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world
was.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was the petition granted?&nbsp; Answer, ye
Roman sentinels, who watched His sepulchre!&nbsp; Answer, ye men
of Galilee, who gazed upon His chariot, as He ascended from the
mount of Olives!</p>
<p>The glorification of the Son by the Father implies all the
honours of His mediatorial office&mdash;all the crowns which He
won by His victory over the powers of death, and hell.&nbsp; The
Father raised Him from the dead, and received Him up into glory,
as a testimony of His acceptance as the sinner&rsquo;s
Surety&mdash;an expression of perfect satisfaction with His
vicarious sacrifice upon the cross.&nbsp; It was the just reward
of His work; it was the fruit of His gracious travail.&nbsp; He
is &ldquo;crowned with glory and honour for the sufferings of
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because He hath poured out His soul
unto death,&rdquo; therefore &ldquo;God also hath highly exalted
Him, and given Him a name that is above every name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What an honour would it be to a man, to receive eight, or ten
of the highest offices in the kingdom!&nbsp; Infinitely greater
is the glory of Emmanuel.&nbsp; His name includes all the
offices, and titles of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; The Father
hath made Him &ldquo;both Lord, and Christ&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
given Him the supreme prerogatives of government and
salvation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him hath God exalted to be a prince and a
Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is &ldquo;head over all things in the
Church&rdquo;&mdash;Prime Minister in the kingdom of
heaven&mdash;Lord Treasurer, dispensing the bounties <a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>of Divine
grace to mankind&mdash;Lord High-Chancellor of the Realm, and
Keeper of the great Seal of the living God; holding in His hand
the charter of our redemption, and certifying the authenticity of
the Divine covenant&mdash;Lord Chief Justice of heaven, and
earth, having all power, and authority to administer the laws of
Providence throughout the universe&mdash;the chief
Prince&mdash;the General of the army&mdash;the Captain of the
Lord&rsquo;s host&mdash;the Champion who conquered Satan, sin,
and death; bruising the head of the first, destroying the power
of the second, and swallowing up the third in victory.&nbsp; He
hath the keys of hell, and of death.&nbsp; He shutteth, and no
man openeth; He openeth, and no man shutteth.&nbsp; He bears all
the honours of His Father&rsquo;s house; and concentrates in
Himself all the glories of Supreme Divinity, redeemed humanity,
and &ldquo;mediator between God, and man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit glorifies Father and Son
together.&nbsp; He is procured for the world by the blood of the
Son, and sent into the world by the authority of the Father; so
that both are alike represented in His mission, and equally
glorified in His office.&nbsp; The gracious things which the
Father gave into the hands of the Son, when He descended from
heaven, the Son gave into the hands of the Spirit, when He
returned to heaven.&nbsp; &ldquo;All things that the Father hath
are mine; and He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the object of the Spirit&rsquo;s advent, the
communication of the things of Christ to men.&nbsp; What are the
things of Christ?&nbsp; His merit, His mercy, His image, His
Gospel, His promises, all the gifts of His grace, all the
treasures of His love, and all the immunities of eternal
redemption.&nbsp; These the Father hath given to the Son, as the
great Trustee of the Church; and the Son hath given them to the
Spirit, as the appointed Agent of their communication.</p>
<p>A ship was laden in India, arrived safely in London, unloaded
her precious cargo, and the goods were soon distributed all over
the country, and offered for sale in a <a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>thousand
stores.&nbsp; The Son of God brought immense riches of Divine
grace from heaven to earth, which are all left to the disposal of
the Holy Spirit, and freely proffered to the perishing, wherever
the Gospel is preached.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit came, not to construct a new engine of mercy,
but to propel that already constructed by Christ.&nbsp; Its first
revolution rent the rocks of Calvary, and shook the rocky hearts
of men.&nbsp; Its second revolution demolished the throne of
death, burst his prison-doors, and liberated many of his
captives.&nbsp; Its third revolution carried its builder up into
the Heaven of heavens, and brought down the Holy Spirit to move
its machinery for ever.&nbsp; Its next revolution, under the
impulse of this new Agent, was like &ldquo;the rushing of a
mighty wind&rdquo; among the assembled disciples at Jerusalem,
kindled a fire upon the head of every Christian, inspired them to
speak all the languages of the babbling earth, and killed, and
quickened three thousand souls of the hearers.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is still on earth, glorifying the Father, and
the Son.&nbsp; He convinces the world of sin.&nbsp; He leads men
to Christ, through the rivers of corruption, the mountains of
presumption, and the terrible bogs of despair, affording them no
rest till they come to the city of refuge.&nbsp; He continues on
the field to bring up the rear; while the Captain of our
Salvation, on His white horse, rides victorious in the van of
battle.&nbsp; He strengthens the soldiers&mdash;&ldquo;faint, yet
pursuing!&rdquo; raises the fallen; encourages the despondent;
feeds them with the bread of life, and the new wine of the
kingdom; and leads them on&mdash;&ldquo;conquering and to
conquer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His work will not be finished till the resurrection.&nbsp;
Then will He quicken our mortal bodies.&nbsp; Then will He light
His candle, and sweep the house till He find every lost piece of
silver.&nbsp; Then will He descend into the dark caves of death,
and gather all the gems of redeemed humanity, and weave them into
a crown for Emmanuel, and place that crown upon Emmanuel&rsquo;s
head, amid the songs of the adoring seraphim!</p>
<p><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>Thus
the Holy Spirit glorifies the Father, and the Son.&nbsp; Let us
pray for the outpouring of His grace upon the Church.&nbsp; In
proportion to His manifestation in our hearts, will be our
&ldquo;knowledge of the light of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor is this all; in proportion to the
visitations of the Holy Spirit, will be the purity of our lives,
the spirituality of our worship, the ardour of our zeal, and
charity, and the extent of our usefulness to the cause of
Christ.&nbsp; Would you see a revival of religion? pray for the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon you, to sanctify your hearts,
and lives, that your light may &ldquo;so shine before men, that
others may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of
the mulberry trees, then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then the
Lord shall go out before thee, to strike the hosts of the
Philistines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brethren, this is the time.&nbsp; The
mulberry trees are shaking.&nbsp; God is going before His people,
to prepare their way to victory.&nbsp; The hand of Divine
Providence is opening a great, and effectual door for the
Gospel.&nbsp; The mountains are levelled, the valleys are
exalted, and a highway is cast up in the wilderness for our
God.&nbsp; The arts of printing, and navigation, the increasing
commerce of the world, the general prevalence of the Spirit of
peace, the rapid march of literature and science, and the
correspondence of eminent and leading men in every nation, are so
many preparatives for the moral conquest of the world.&nbsp; The
Captain of our Salvation, on the white horse of the Gospel, can
now ride through Europe and America: and will soon lead forth His
army, to take possession of Asia, and Africa.&nbsp; The wings of
the mighty angel are unbound, and he is flying in the midst of
heaven.</p>
<p>Again: Christians are better informed concerning the moral
state of the world than formerly.&nbsp; If my neighbour&rsquo;s
house were on fire, and I knew nothing of it, I could not be
blamed for rendering him no assistance; but who could be <a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>guiltless
in beholding the building in flames, without an effort to rescue
its occupants?&nbsp; Brethren, you have heard of the perishing
heathen.&nbsp; You have heard of their dreadful superstitions,
their human sacrifices, and their abominable rites.&nbsp; You
have heard of Juggernaut, and the River Ganges, and the murder of
infants, and the immolation of widows, and the worship of idols,
and demons.&nbsp; You know something of the delusion of
Mohammedanism, the cruel, and degrading ignorance of Popery, and
how millions around you are perishing for the lack of
knowledge.&nbsp; Do you feel no solicitude for their
souls&mdash;no desire to pluck them as brands from the
burning?</p>
<p>What can we do?&nbsp; The Scriptures have been translated into
nearly all the languages of the babbling earth.&nbsp;
Missionaries have gone into many lands&mdash;have met the Indian
in his wigwam, the African in his Devil&rsquo;s-bush, and the
devotee on his way to Mecca.&nbsp; We can furnish more men for
the field, and more money to sustain them.&nbsp; But these things
cannot change, and renovate the human heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not by
might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the grand regenerating agency.&nbsp;
He alone can convince and save the world.&nbsp; His aid is given
in answer to prayer; and the Father is more ready to give than we
are to ask.</p>
<p>Mr. Ward, one of the Baptist missionaries in India, in a
missionary discourse at Bristol, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Brethren, we
need your money,&mdash;we need your prayers more.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Oh, what encouragement we have to pray for our
missionaries!&nbsp; Thus saith the Lord: &ldquo;I will pour water
upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will
pour out my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us plead with God for the
accomplishment of the promise, &ldquo;Ye that make mention of the
Lord, keep not silence, and give Him no rest till He make
Jerusalem a praise in the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethren in the ministry! let us remember that all our <a
name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>success
depends upon the aid of the Holy Spirit, and let us pray
constantly for His blessing upon the world!&nbsp; Brethren in the
Church! forget not the connection between the work of the Holy
Spirit and the glory of your Best Friend, and earnestly entreat
Him to mingle His sanctifying unction with the treasures of
Divine Truth contained in these earthern vessels!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Finally, Brethren, pray for us; that the Word of the Lord
may have free course and be glorified; and all the ends of the
earth see the salvation of our God!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>SERMON V.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Cedar of God</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Thus saith the Lord God</i>: <i>I will
also take of the highest branch of the high cedar</i>, <i>and
will set it</i>; <i>I will crop off from the top of his young
twigs a tender one</i>, <i>and plant it upon a high mountain and
eminent</i>; <i>in the mountain of the height of Israel will I
plant it</i>: <i>and it shall bring forth boughs</i>, <i>and bear
fruit</i>, <i>and be a goodly cedar</i>; <i>and under it shall
dwell all fowl of every wing</i>; <i>in the shadow of the
branches thereof shall they dwell</i>; <i>and all the trees of
the field shall know that I</i>, <i>the Lord</i>, <i>have brought
down the high tree</i>, <i>and have exalted the low
tree&mdash;have dried up the green tree</i>, <i>and have made the
dry tree to flourish</i>.&nbsp; <i>I</i>, <i>the Lord</i>,
<i>have spoken</i>, <i>and I have done it</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> xvii. 22&ndash;24.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You perceive that our text abounds in the beautiful language
of allegory.&nbsp; In the context is portrayed the captivity of
the children of Israel, and especially the carrying away of the
royal family by the king of Babylon.&nbsp; Here God promises to
restore them to their own land, in greater prosperity than ever;
and to raise up Messiah, the Branch, out of the house of David,
to be their king.&nbsp; All this is presented in a glowing
figurative style, dressed out in all the wealth of poetic imagery
so peculiar to the Orientals.&nbsp; Nebuchadnezzar, the great
eagle&mdash;the long-winged, full-feathered, embroidered
eagle&mdash;is represented as coming to Lebanon, and taking the
highest branch of the tallest cedar, bearing it off <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>as the crow
bears the acorn in its beak, and planting it in the land of
traffic.&nbsp; The Lord God, in His turn, takes the highest
branch of the same cedar, and plants it on the high mountain of
Israel, where it flourishes and bears fruit, and the fowls of the
air dwell under the shadow of its branches.</p>
<p>We will make a few general remarks on the character of the
promise, and then pass to a more particular consideration of its
import.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; This is an <i>evangelical</i> promise.&nbsp; It
relates to the coming and kingdom of Messiah.&nbsp; Not one of
the kings of Judah since the captivity, as Boothroyd well
observes, answers to the description here given.&nbsp; Not one of
them was a cedar whose branches could afford shadow, and shelter
for all the fowls of heaven.&nbsp; But the prophecy receives its
fulfilment in Christ, the Desire of all nations, to whom the ends
of the earth shall come for salvation.</p>
<p>This prophecy bears a striking resemblance, in several
particulars, to the parable of the mustard-seed, delivered by our
Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mustard-seed,&rdquo; said Jesus, &ldquo;is
the least of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is the greatest
among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air
come and lodge in the branches thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the
delicate twig of the young, and tender branch, becomes a goodly
cedar, and under its shadow dwell all fowl, of every wing.&nbsp;
The prophecy, and the parable are alike intended to represent the
growth, and prosperity of Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom, and the
gracious protection, and spiritual refreshment afforded to its
subjects.&nbsp; Christ is the mustard plant, and cedar of God;
and to Him shall the gathering of all the people be; and
multitudes of pardoned sinners shall sit under His shadow, with
great delight, and His fruit shall be sweet to their taste.</p>
<p>This prophecy is a promise of the true, and faithful, and
immutable God.&nbsp; It begins with&mdash;&ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord God, I will do thus and so;&rdquo; and concludes
with&mdash;&ldquo;I, the Lord, have spoken, and I have done
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no peradventure with God.&nbsp; His
Word is for ever settled in <a name="page398"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 398</span>heaven, and cannot fail of its
fulfilment.&nbsp; When He says, &ldquo;I promise to pay,&rdquo;
there is no failure, whatever the sum.&nbsp; The Bank of grace
cannot break.&nbsp; It is the oldest and best in the
universe.&nbsp; Its capital is infinite; its credit is
infallible.&nbsp; The mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the
Prince of Peace, is able to fulfil, to the utmost, all His
engagements.&nbsp; He can do anything that does not imply a
contradiction, or a moral absurdity.&nbsp; He could take upon
Himself the form of a servant, and become obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross; but we can never forget, or
disregard, His promise, any more than He can cease to
exist.&nbsp; His nature renders both impossible.&nbsp; Heaven,
and earth shall pass away, but His word shall not pass
away.&nbsp; Every jot, and tittle shall be fulfilled.&nbsp; This
is the consolation of the Church.&nbsp; Here rested the
patriarchs, and prophets.&nbsp; Here reposes the faith of the
saints, to the end of time.&nbsp; God abideth faithful; He cannot
deny Himself.&nbsp; Our text is already partially verified in the
advent of Christ, and the establishment of His Church; the
continuous growth of the gospel kingdom indicates its progressive
fulfilment; and we anticipate the time, as not far distant, when
the whole earth shall be overshadowed by the branches of the
cedar of God.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; We proceed to consider, with a little more
particularity, the import of this evangelical prophecy.&nbsp; It
describes the character, and mediatorial kingdom of Christ, and
the blessings which He confers upon His people.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His character and mediatorial kingdom.&mdash;&ldquo;I
will take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set
it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one,
and plant it upon a high mountain and eminent; in the mountain of
the height of Israel will I plant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ, as concerning the flesh, is of the seed of
Abraham&mdash;a rod issuing from the stem of Jesse, and a branch
growing out of his root.&nbsp; As the new vine is found in the
cluster, and one saith, &ldquo;Destroy it not, for a blessing is
in it,&rdquo; so <a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>the children of Israel were spared, notwithstanding
their perverseness, and their backslidings, because they were the
cluster from which should be expressed in due time the new wine
of the kingdom&mdash;because from them was to come forth the
blessing, the promised seed, in whom all the families of the
earth shall be blessed.&nbsp; The Word that was in the beginning
with God, one with God, in essence, and in attributes, in the
fulness of time assumed our nature, and tabernacled, and dwelt
among us.&nbsp; Here is the union of God, and man.&nbsp; Here is
the great mystery of godliness&mdash;God manifest in the
flesh.&nbsp; But I have only time now to take off my shoes, and
draw near the burning bush, and gaze a moment upon this great
sight.</p>
<p>The Father is represented as preparing a body, for His
Son.&nbsp; He goes to the quarry to seek a stone, a
foundation-stone, for Zion.&nbsp; The angel said to
Mary:&mdash;&ldquo;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore that Holy
Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Eternal lays hold on that nature which is
hastening downward, on the flood of sin, to the gulf of death,
and destruction, and binds it to Himself.&nbsp; Though made in
the likeness of sinful flesh, He was holy, harmless, and
undefiled.&nbsp; He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in
His mouth.&nbsp; The rod out of the stem of Jesse is also
Jehovah, our righteousness.&nbsp; The Child born in Bethlehem is
the mighty God.&nbsp; The Son given to Israel is the Everlasting
Father.&nbsp; He is of the seed of Abraham, according to the
flesh; but he is also the true God, and eternal life.&nbsp; Two
natures, and three offices meet mysteriously in His Person.&nbsp;
He is at once the bleeding sacrifice, the sanctifying altar, the
officiating priest, the prophet of Israel, and the Prince of
Peace.&nbsp; All this was necessary that He might become
&ldquo;the Author of eternal salvation, to all them that obey
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hear Jehovah speaking of Messiah and His
kingdom:&mdash;&ldquo;Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain <a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>thing?&nbsp; The kings of the earth set themselves, and
the rulers take council together against the Lord, and against
His anointed.&nbsp; Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of
Zion.&nbsp; I will declare the decree by which He is to rule His
redeemed empire.&rdquo;&nbsp; That decree, long kept secret, was
gradually announced by the prophets, but at the new tomb of
Joseph of Arimathea, Jehovah Himself proclaimed it aloud, to the
astonishment of earth, the terror of hell, and the joy of
heaven:&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten
Thee.&nbsp; Come forth from the womb of the grave, thou whose
goings forth have been from of old, even from everlasting.&nbsp;
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for Thine
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy
possession.&nbsp; I will exalt Thee to the throne of the
universe, and thou shalt be chief in the chariot of the
Gospel.&nbsp; Thou shalt ride through the dark places of the
earth, with the lamps of eternal life suspended to Thy chariot,
enlightening the world.&nbsp; Be wise, now, therefore, O ye
kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.&nbsp; Serve the
Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.&nbsp; Kiss the Son,
lest He be angry, and ye perish from the way when His wrath is
kindled but a little.&nbsp; Let no man withstand Him.&nbsp; Let
no man seek to stay His progress.&nbsp; Herod, Pilate, Caiaphas,
stand off! clear the way! lest ye be crushed beneath the wheels
of His chariot! for that which is a savour of life to some, is to
others a savour of death; and if this stone shall fall upon you,
it shall grind you to powder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behold, here is wisdom!&nbsp; All other mysteries are toys, in
comparison with the mystery of the everlasting gospel&mdash;the
union of three Persons in the Godhead&mdash;the union of two
natures in the Mediator&mdash;the union of believers in Christ,
as the branches to the vine&mdash;the union of all the saints
together in Him, who is the head of the body, and the chief stone
of the corner&mdash;the mighty God transfixed to the
cross&mdash;the Son of Mary ruling in the Heaven of
heavens&mdash;the rod of Jesse becoming the sceptre of universal
dominion&mdash;the <a name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
401</span>Branch growing out of his root, the little delicate
branch which a lamb might crop for its food, terrifying and
taming the serpent, the lion, the leopard, the tiger, and the
wolf, and transforming into gentleness, and love, the wild, and
savage nature of all the beasts of prey upon the mountain!&nbsp;
&ldquo;And such,&rdquo; old Corinthian sinners, &ldquo;were some
of you; but ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified,
in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And such, my brethren, were some of you; but ye
have been made a new creation in Jesus Christ; old things are
passed away, and all things are become new.&nbsp; Ye are dead,
and your life is hid with Christ in God.&nbsp; He is one with the
Father, and ye are one in Him; united and interwoven, like the
roots of the trees in the forest of Lebanon; so that none can
injure the least disciple of Christ, without touching the apple
of His eye, and grieving all His members.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The blessings which He confers upon His
people.&nbsp; It shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be
a goodly cedar, and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing;
in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell; and all
the trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought
down the high tree, and have exalted the low tree&mdash;have
dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to
flourish.</p>
<p><i>Christ is a fruitful tree</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tree is
known by his fruit.&nbsp; Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor
figs of thistles.&nbsp; Every good tree bringeth forth good
fruit, and every evil tree bringeth forth evil
fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a singular, supernatural tree.&nbsp;
Though its top reaches to the Heaven of heavens, its branches
fill the universe, and bend down to the earth, laden with the
precious fruits of pardon, and holiness, and eternal life.&nbsp;
On the day of Pentecost, we see them hang so low over Jerusalem,
that the very murderers of the Son of God reach, and pluck, and
eat, and three thousand sinners feast on more than angels&rsquo;
food.&nbsp; That was the feast <a name="page402"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 402</span>of first-fruits.&nbsp; Never before
was there such a harvest and such a festival.&nbsp; Angels know
nothing of the delicious fruits of the tree of redemption.&nbsp;
They know nothing of the joy of pardon, and the spirit of
adoption.&nbsp; The Bride of the Lamb alone can
say:&mdash;&ldquo;As the apple-tree among the trees of the
forest, so is my beloved among the sons.&nbsp; I sat down under
his shadow, with great delight, and his fruit was sweet, to my
taste.&nbsp; He brought me also to his banqueting-house, and his
banner over me was love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These blessings are the precious effects of Christ&rsquo;s
mediatorial work; flowing down to all believers, like streams of
living water.&nbsp; Come, ye famishing souls, and take, without
money, and without price.&nbsp; All things are now ready.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all
manner of pleasant fruits, both new, and old.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
is no scarcity.&nbsp; Our Elder Brother keeps a rich table in our
Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Hear Him proclaiming in the streets
of the city, in the chief places of concourse:&mdash;&ldquo;Come
to the festival.&nbsp; There is bread enough, and to spare.&nbsp;
My oxen, and my fatlings are killed.&nbsp; My board is spread
with the most delicious delicacies&mdash;wine on the lees well
refined, and fruits such as angels never tasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Christ is a tree of protection to His people</i>.&nbsp;
This cedar not only beautifies the forest, but also affords
shade, and shelter for the fowls of the air.&nbsp; We have the
same idea in the parable of the mustard-seed, &ldquo;The birds of
the air came and lodged in the branches thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is the fulfilment of the promise concerning Shiloh,
&ldquo;To Him shall the gathering of the people be.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is the drawing of sinners to Christ, and the union of
believers with God.&nbsp; &ldquo;All fowl of every
wing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sinners of every age, and every
degree&mdash;sinners of all languages, colours, and
climes&mdash;sinners of all principles, customs, and
habits&mdash;sinners whose crimes are of the blackest
hue&mdash;sinners carrying about them the savour of the brimstone
of hell&mdash;sinners deserving eternal damnation&mdash;sinners
perishing for lack of knowledge&mdash;sinners <a
name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>pierced by
the arrows of conviction&mdash;sinners ready to sink under the
burden of sin&mdash;sinners overwhelmed with terror and
despair&mdash;are seen flying to Christ as a cloud, and as doves
to their windows&mdash;moving to the ark of mercy before the door
is shut&mdash;seeking rest in the shadow of this goodly
cedar!</p>
<p>Christ is the sure defence of His Church.&nbsp; A thousand
times has she been assailed by her enemies.&nbsp; The princes of
the earth have set themselves in array against her, and hell has
opened upon her all its batteries.&nbsp; But the Rock of Ages has
ever been her strong fortress, and high tower.&nbsp; He will
never refuse to shelter her from her adversaries.&nbsp; In the
time of trouble He shall hide her in His pavilion; in the secret
of His tabernacle shall He hide her.&nbsp; When the heavens are
dark, and angry, she flies, like the affrighted dove, to the
thick branches of the &ldquo;Goodly Cedar.&rdquo;&nbsp; There she
is safe from the windy storm, and tempest.&nbsp; There she may
rest in confidence, till these calamities be overpast.&nbsp; The
tree of her protection can never be riven by the lightning, nor
broken by the blast.</p>
<p><i>Christ is the source of life</i>, <i>and beauty to all the
trees in the garden of God</i>.&nbsp; Jehovah determined to teach
&ldquo;the trees of the forest&rdquo; a new lesson.&nbsp; Let the
princes of this world hear it, and the proud philosophers of
Greece and Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have brought down the high tree,
and exalted the low tree&mdash;I have dried up the green tree,
and made the dry tree to flourish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many things have
occurred, in the providence of God, which might illustrate these
metaphors; such as the bringing of Pharaoh down to the bottom of
the sea, that Israel might be exalted to sing the song of Moses;
and the drying up of the pride, and pomp of Haman, that Mordecai
might flourish in honour, and esteem.&nbsp; But for the most
transcendent accomplishment of the prophecy, we must go to
Calvary.&nbsp; There is the high tree, brought down to the dust
of death, that the low tree might be exalted to life eternal; the
green tree dried up by the fires of Divine <a
name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 404</span>wrath, that
the dry tree might flourish in the favour of God for ever.</p>
<p>To this, particularly, our blessed Redeemer seems to refer, in
His address to the daughters of Jerusalem, as they follow Him,
weeping, to the place of crucifixion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weep not for
me,&rdquo; saith He.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a mystery in all this,
which you cannot now comprehend.&nbsp; Like Joseph, I have been
sold by my brethren; but like Joseph, I will be a blessing to all
my Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I am carrying this cross to
Calvary, that I may be crucified upon it between two thieves; but
when the lid of the mystical ark shall be lifted, then shall ye
see that it is to save sinners I give my back to the smiters, and
my life for a sacrifice.&nbsp; Weep not for me, but for
yourselves, and your children; for if they do these things in the
green tree, what shall be done in the dry?&nbsp; I am the green
tree to-day; and, behold, I am consumed, that you may
flourish.&nbsp; I am the high tree, and am prostrated that you
may be exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire-brands of Jerusalem had well-nigh kindled to a flame
of themselves, amid the tumult of the people, when they cried
out, &ldquo;Away with Him!&nbsp; Crucify Him!&nbsp; His blood be
on us, and on our children!&rdquo;&nbsp; O wonder of mercy! that
they were not seized and consumed at once by fire from
heaven!&nbsp; But He whom they crucify prays for them, and they
are spared.&nbsp; Hear His intercession:&mdash;&ldquo;Father,
forgive them! save these sinners, ready for the fire.&nbsp; On
me, on me alone, be the fierceness of Thy indignation.&nbsp; I am
ready to drink the cup which Thou hast mingled, I am willing to
fall beneath the stroke of Thy angry justice.&nbsp; I come to
suffer for the guilty.&nbsp; Bind me in their stead, lay me upon
the altar, and send down fire to consume the
Sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was done.&nbsp; I heard a great voice from
heaven:&mdash;&ldquo;Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd!&nbsp;
Kindle the flame!&nbsp; Let off the artillery!&rdquo;&nbsp; Night
suddenly enveloped the earth.&nbsp; Nature trembled around
me.&nbsp; I heard the <a name="page405"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 405</span>rending of the rocks.&nbsp; I
looked, and lo! the stroke had fallen upon the high tree, and the
green tree was all on fire!&nbsp; While I gazed, I heard a voice,
mournful, but strangely sweet, &ldquo;My God! my God! why hast
Thou forsaken me?&nbsp; My heart is like wax; it is melted in the
midst of my bowels.&nbsp; My strength is dried up like a
potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws.&nbsp; One may tell
all my bones.&nbsp; Dogs have compassed me about; strong bulls of
Bashan have beset me.&nbsp; They stare at me; they gape upon me
with their mouths; they pierce my hands and my feet.&nbsp;
Deliver my soul from the lions; my darling from the power of the
dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; O with what majestic
sweetness fell that voice upon my soul!&nbsp; Instantly the
clouds were scattered.&nbsp; I looked, and saw, with unspeakable
wonder, millions of the low trees shooting up, and millions of
the dry trees putting forth leaves, and fruit.&nbsp; Then I took
my harp, and sang this song:&mdash;&ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb! for
He was humbled that we might be exalted; He was wounded that we
might be healed; He was robbed that we might be enriched; He was
slain that we might live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw the beam of a great scale; one end descending to
the abyss, borne down by the power of the Atonement; the other
ascending to the Heaven of heavens, and lifting up the prisoners
of the tomb.&nbsp; Wonderful scheme!&nbsp; Christ condemned for
our justification; forsaken of His Father, that we might enjoy
His fellowship; passing under the curse of the law, to bear it
away from the believer for ever!&nbsp; This is the great scale of
Redemption.&nbsp; As one end the beam falls under the load of our
sins, which were laid on Christ; the other rises, bearing the
basket of mercy, full of pardons, and blessings, and hopes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He who knew no sin was made sin for us&rdquo;&mdash;that
is His end of the beam; &ldquo;that we might be made the
righteousness of God in Him&rdquo;&mdash;this is ours.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became
poor,&rdquo;&mdash;there goes His end down; &ldquo;that we,
through His poverty, might be rich,&rdquo;&mdash;here comes ours
up.</p>
<p><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>O
sinners! ye withered and fallen trees, fuel for the everlasting
burning, ready to ignite at the first spark of vengeance!&nbsp; O
ye faithless souls! self-ruined and self-condemned! enemies in
your hearts by wicked works! we pray you, in Christ&rsquo;s
stead, be ye reconciled to God!&nbsp; He has found out a plan for
your salvation&mdash;to raise up the low tree, by humbling the
high, and save the dry tree from the fire, by burning up the
green.&nbsp; He is able to put, at the same time, a crown of
glory on the head of the law, and a crown of mercy on the head of
the sinner.&nbsp; One of those hands which were nailed to the
cross blotted out the fiery handwriting of Sinai, while the other
opened the prison-doors of the captives.&nbsp; From the
mysterious depths of Messiah&rsquo;s sufferings flows the river
of the waters of life.&nbsp; Eternal light rises from the gloom
of Gethsemane.&nbsp; Satan planted the tree of death on the grave
of the first Adam, and sought to plant it also on the grave of
the second; but how terrible was his disappointment and despair,
when he found that the wrong seed had been deposited there, and
was springing up into everlasting life!&nbsp; Come! fly to the
shelter of this tree, and dwell in the shadow of its branches,
and eat of its fruit, and live!</p>
<p>To conclude:&mdash;Is not the conversion of sinners an object
dear to the hearts of the saints?&nbsp; God alone can do the
work.&nbsp; He can say to the north, Give up; and to the south,
Keep not back.&nbsp; He can bring His sons from afar, and His
daughters from the ends of the earth.&nbsp; Our Shiloh has an
attractive power, and to Him shall the gathering of the people
be.&nbsp; Pray, my brethren, pray earnestly, that the God of all
grace may find them out, and gather them from the forest, and
fish them up from the sea, and bring them home as the shepherd
brings the stray lambs to the fold.&nbsp; God alone can catch
these &ldquo;fowl of every wing.&rdquo;&nbsp; They fly away from
us.&nbsp; To our grief they often fly far away, when we think
them almost in our hands; and then the most talented and holy
ministers cannot overtake them.&nbsp; But the <a
name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>Lord is
swifter than they.&nbsp; His arrows will reach them and bring
them from their lofty flight to the earth.&nbsp; Then He will
heal their wounds, and tame their wild nature, and give them rest
beneath the branches of the &ldquo;Goodly Cedar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following is so characteristic that, although it is in
circulation as a tract, it shall be quoted here; it has been
called&mdash;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">A Sermon on the Welsh Hills</span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> once preached from the text,
&ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, my dear brethren,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why will you
pay no attention to your best Friend?&nbsp; Why will you let Him
stand knocking, night and day, in all weathers, and never open
the door to Him?&nbsp; If the horse-dealer, or cattle-drover
came, you would run to open the door to him, and set meat, and
drink before him, because you think to make money by
him&mdash;the filthy lucre that perishes in the using.&nbsp; But
when the Lord Jesus stands knocking at the door of your heart,
bringing to you the everlasting wealth, which He gives without
money, and without price, you are deaf, and blind; you are so
busy, you can&rsquo;t attend.&nbsp; Markets, and fairs, and
pleasures, and profits occupy you; you have neither time, nor
inclination for such as He.&nbsp; Let Him knock!&nbsp; Let Him
stand without, the door shut in His face, what matters it to
you?&nbsp; Oh, but it does matter to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my brethren!&nbsp; I will relate to you a parable
of truth.&nbsp; In a familiar parable I will tell you how it is
with some of you, and, alas! how it will be in the end.&nbsp; I
will tell you what happened in a Welsh village, I need not say
where.&nbsp; I was going through this village in early spring,
and saw before me a beautiful house.&nbsp; The farmer had just
brought into the yard his load of lime; his horses were fat, <a
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>and all
were well to do about him.&nbsp; He went in, and sat down to his
dinner, and as I came up a man stood knocking at the door.&nbsp;
There was a friendly look in his face that made me say as I
passed, &lsquo;The master&rsquo;s at home; they won&rsquo;t keep
you waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before long I was again on that road, and as soon as I
came in sight of the house, there stood the same man
knocking.&nbsp; At this I wondered, and as I came near I saw that
he stood as one who had knocked long; and as he knocked he
listened.&nbsp; Said I, &lsquo;The farmer is busy making up his
books, or counting his money, or eating, and drinking.&nbsp;
Knock louder, sir, and he will hear you.&nbsp; But,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;you have great patience, sir, for you have been
knocking a long time.&nbsp; If I were you I would leave him
to-night, and come back to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is in danger, and I must warn him,&rsquo;
replied he; and knocked louder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time afterwards I went that way again, and there
still stood the man, knocking, knocking, knocking.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;your perseverance is the
most remarkable I ever saw!&nbsp; How long do you mean to
stop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Till I can make him hear,&rsquo; was his answer;
and he knocked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I, &lsquo;He wants for no good thing.&nbsp; He has
a fine farm, and flocks, and herds, and stack-yards, and
barns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;for the Lord is
kind to the unthankful, and the evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he knocked again, and I went on my way, wondering
at the goodness, and patience of this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again I was in those parts.&nbsp; It was very cold
weather.&nbsp; There was an east wind blowing, and the sleety
rain fell.&nbsp; It was getting dark, too, and the pleasantest
place, as you all know, at such a time, is the fireside.&nbsp; As
I came by the farm-house I saw the candle-light shining through
the windows, and the smoke of a good fire coming out of the
chimney.&nbsp; But there was still the man
outside&mdash;knocking, <a name="page409"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 409</span>knocking!&nbsp; And as I looked at
him I saw that his hands, and feet were bare, and bleeding, and
his visage as that of one marred with sorrow.&nbsp; My heart was
very sad for him, and I said, &lsquo;Sir, you had better not
stand any longer at that hard man&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Let me
advise you to go over the way to the poor widow.&nbsp; She has
many children, and she works for her daily bread; but she will
make you welcome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know her,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
with her continually; her door is ever open to me, for the Lord
is the husband of the widow, and the father of the
fatherless.&nbsp; She is in bed with her little
children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then go,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;to the
blacksmith&rsquo;s yonder.&nbsp; I see the cheerful blaze of his
smithy; he works early, and late.&nbsp; His wife is a
kind-hearted woman.&nbsp; They will treat you like a
prince.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He answered solemnly, &lsquo;<i>I am not come to call
the righteous</i>, <i>but sinners to repentance</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that moment the door opened, and the farmer came
out, cursing, and swearing, with a cudgel in his hand, with which
he smote him, and then angrily shut the door in his face.&nbsp;
This excited a fierce anger in me.&nbsp; I was full of
indignation to think that a Welshman should treat a stranger in
that fashion.&nbsp; I was ready to burst into the house, and
maltreat him in his turn.&nbsp; But the patient stranger laid his
hand upon my arm, and said, &lsquo;Blessed are the meek: for they
shall inherit the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;your patience,
and your long-suffering are wonderful; they are beyond my
comprehension.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord is long-suffering, full of compassion,
slow to anger, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance.&rsquo;&nbsp; And again he knocked, as
he answered me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dark; the smithy was closed; they were shutting
up the inn, and I made haste to get shelter for the night,
wondering more, and more at the patience, and pity of the
man.&nbsp; In the public-house I learned from the landlord the <a
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>character
of the farmer, and, late as it was, I went back to the patient
stranger and said, &lsquo;Sir, come away; he is not worth all
this trouble.&nbsp; He is a hard, cruel, wicked man.&nbsp; He has
robbed the fatherless, he has defamed his friend, he has built
his house in iniquity.&nbsp; Come away, sir.&nbsp; Make yourself
comfortable with us, by the warm fireside.&nbsp; This man is not
worth saving.&rsquo;&nbsp; With that he spread his bleeding palms
before me, and showed me his bleeding feet, and his side which
they had pierced; and I beheld it was the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Smite him, Lord!&rsquo; I cried in my
indignation; &lsquo;then perhaps he will hear thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of a truth he <i>shall</i> hear me.&nbsp; In the
day of judgment he shall hear me when I say, Depart from me, thou
worker of iniquity, into everlasting darkness, prepared for the
devil and his angels.&rsquo;&nbsp; After these words I saw Him no
more.&nbsp; The wind blew, and the sleety rain fell, and I went
back to the inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the night there was a knocking at my chamber.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Christmas <i>bach</i>!&rsquo; <a name="citation410"></a><a
href="#footnote410" class="citation">[410]</a> cried my landlord,
&lsquo;get up! get up!&nbsp; You are wanted with a neighbour, who
is at the point of death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away I hurried along the street, to the end of the
village, to the very farm-house where the stranger had been
knocking.&nbsp; But before I got there, I heard the voice of his
agony: &lsquo;Oh, Lord Jesus, save me!&nbsp; Oh, Lord Jesus, have
mercy upon me!&nbsp; Yet a day&mdash;yet an hour for
repentance!&nbsp; Oh, Lord, save me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife was wringing her hands, his children were
frightened out of their senses.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray! pray for
me!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Christmas <i>bach</i>, cry
to God for <i>me</i>!&nbsp; He will hear <i>you</i>;
<i>me</i>!&nbsp; He will not hear!&rsquo;&nbsp; I knelt to pray;
but it was too late.&nbsp; He was gone.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
